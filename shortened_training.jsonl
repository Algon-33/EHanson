{"completion": " Now think about the space of job tasks as a similar sort of landscape. Two tasks are adjacent to other tasks when the same person tends to do both, when info or objects are passed from one to the other, when they take place close in place and time, and when their details gain from being coordinated. The ease of automating each task depends on how regular and standardized are its inputs, how easy it is to formalize the info on which key choices depend, how easy it is to evaluate and judge outputs, and how simple, stable, and mild are the physical environments in which this task is done.When the tasks near a particular task get more automated, those tasks tend more to happen in a more controlled stable environment, the relevant info tends to be more formalized, and related info and objects get simpler, more standardized, and more reliably available. And this all tends to make it easier to automate such tasks. Much like how land is easier to colonize when nearby land is more colonized.Among the job features that predict automation in our analysis, the strongest is: Pace Determined By Speed Of Equipment. This feature clearly fits my story here; it says you coordinate your task closely with a task done by a machine. Many others fit as well; here is more from our paper:Pace Determined By Speed Of Equipment picks out jobs that coordinate closely with machinery, while Importance of Repeating Same Tasks picks out jobs with many similar and independent small tasks. Variety picks out an opposite case of dissimilar tasks. The job features Wear Common Safety Equipment and Indoors Environmentally Controlled pick out tasks done in calm stable environments, where machines function better, while Hearing Sensitivity picks out less suitable complex subtle environments. In jobs with frequent Letters and Memos, such memos tend to be short and standardized. Jobs with more Advancement are \u201cresults oriented\u201d, with more clearly measurable results. Simple machines tend to be bad at Thinking Creatively, Innovation and Mathematics. Physical Proximity picks out jobs done close to humans, usually because of needed human interactions, which tend to be complex, and where active machines could risk hurting them.We have long been experiencing a wave of automation passing across the space of job tasks. Some of this increase in automation has been due to falling computer tech costs, improving algorithms and tools, etc. But much of it may simply be the general potential of this tech being realized via a slow steady process with a long delay: the automation of tasks near other recently automated tasks, slowly spreading across the landscape of tasks.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: December 13, 2019 2:20 pm \nTitle: Automation As Colonization Wave\nOur automation data analysis found a few surprising results.

Our descendants are likely to similarly forgo advantages from new ways to cooperate, if those similarly reduce future flexibility and specialization. For example, future societies of brain emulations are likely to be wary of strongly self-cooperating clans of copies of the same original human. While such copy clans have even stronger reasons to cooperate with each other than family clans, copy clans might cause future organizations to suffer even more than do family-based firms, cities, and nations today from clan-based nepotism, and from low quality and inflexible matches of skills to jobs. Ems firms and cities are thus likely to be especially watchful for clan nepotism, and to avoid relying too heavily on any one clan.Yes game theory captures important truths about human behavior, including about costs we pay from failing to fully cooperate. But prisoner\u2019s dilemma style failures to cooperate in simple games comprises only a tiny fraction of all the important things that can and do go wrong in a modern economy.

Talking recently to an entering education Ph.D. student has inspired me to fill that gap.The obvious usual purpose for school is to help people learn how to do useful tasks in life. And the obvious way to help with that is to show students various useful tools, show examples of their use, and then have students practice trying related tasks with related tools. Finally, score students on how well they do these practice tasks, to help others judge their suitability for various positions.In this view, the big question is: how far and in what ways should school tasks differ from the later life tasks for which students are preparing? School tasks can differ from life tasks in many ways, such as in how long they take, how wide a scope of subproblems they encompass, how clearly performance on them can be judged, how many others have previously completed similar tasks, how connected each new task is to one\u2019s recent tasks, what sort of teams take on tasks, and what sort of other distractions one must deal with while working on each task.It seem obvious to me that school tasks must differ greatly from life tasks, at least when kids are young.

We should search well the vast space of possibilities for the best student tasks.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: June 12, 2021 8:00 pm \nTitle: How School Goes Wrong\n\n###\n\n"}
{"completion": " Furthermore, it seems obvious that student tasks often complement each other strongly. Often learning one task helps a lot in learning another task. So we want all the tasks that students eventually take on to fit into a total package where the parts fit well together, and where that package fits well with later life tasks. Which can justify a lot of coordination between the teaching of related topics, and between schools and those who manage life tasks. In addition, there are often scale and scope economies from having many students do similar tasks, especially regarding evaluation. (This coordination isn\u2019t obviously better when governments run schools.)Our simplest general task tool is inference, supported by related \u201cfacts\u201d. That is, one tells students about key facts related to a task class, and shows them examples of drawing relevant inferences from such facts. This \u201cbook learning\u201d is far from the only useful tool, but it is useful often enough to make fact-telling a big fraction of learning for most topics. Yes, it is somewhat possible to teach better general inference, but the scope for this seems vastly overrated.Not only is it hard to choose the package of learning tasks well, it is even harder for non-experts to judge the quality of such packages. And even when one can judge the quality of particular school tasks, their fitting together into large integrated packages makes it hard to push for particular changes.

Talking recently to an entering education Ph.D. student has inspired me to fill that gap.The obvious usual purpose for school is to help people learn how to do useful tasks in life. And the obvious way to help with that is to show students various useful tools, show examples of their use, and then have students practice trying related tasks with related tools. Finally, score students on how well they do these practice tasks, to help others judge their suitability for various positions.In this view, the big question is: how far and in what ways should school tasks differ from the later life tasks for which students are preparing? School tasks can differ from life tasks in many ways, such as in how long they take, how wide a scope of subproblems they encompass, how clearly performance on them can be judged, how many others have previously completed similar tasks, how connected each new task is to one\u2019s recent tasks, what sort of teams take on tasks, and what sort of other distractions one must deal with while working on each task.It seem obvious to me that school tasks must differ greatly from life tasks, at least when kids are young. It is also obvious that choosing school tasks well is hard, but that this can offer huge gains. We should search well the vast space of possibilities for the best student tasks.\n\n###\n\n"}
{"completion": " Over the last few decades there seems to have been a move away from giving students \u201chard\u201d tasks, where one cannot offer clear procedures to follow to succeed. On such hard tasks, teachers show students related tools and examples of prior successful performance, and can offer suggestions on how to improve tasks in progress. But students must flounder and search for how to achieve excellence, and most students will not so achieve. Some have claimed that such hard tasks favor boys, who are less risk-averse.One of the main tasks for grad students is to write research papers. And my grad classes are focused overwhelmingly on this task. This is a hard task, where many will fail, and where evaluations are more subjective. And it is a big task chunk, which takes a long time and is not easily broken down into subtasks that can be evaluated independently. But it is also a task clearly and directly relevant to their future life, at least if they move near academic circles. While academics are willing to water down many school tasks to satisfy various outside pressures, they have so far drawn the line at how they train their own replacements.When teaching undergrads, I usually split the class grade into four quizzes and four short papers. The quizzes are more fact-based, and have more parts and thus less noise in their overall evaluation. With quizzes, I more give students what they, their parents, and their schools want. The papers are harder and have more evaluation noise, but are closer to a life task that I value: using economic tools to argue for a policy position of their choice on a topic that I choose. For papers, I grade using a point system designed to ignore my personal opinions on paper topics.My teaching strategy roughly matches my theory of teaching; I get as close as I can to having my students practice a real life task related to the class topic that I have been assigned. Even if those tasks are hard, even if that makes my evaluations of students more noisy, and even if students like it less. I accept that schools have mostly devolved to sorting students by prestige, instead of preparing them for life tasks. But in my classes, I do what I can to resist that trend.Added 11a: The main obstacle to replacing college with real jobs is finding ways to standardize across such jobs the topics learned and performance evaluation. That will just require a lot of trial and error to figure out. Don\u2019t invest in a firm that claims to know the answers if you aren\u2019t willing to pay for lots of trial and error time.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Furthermore, it seems obvious that student tasks often complement each other strongly. Often learning one task helps a lot in learning another task. So we want all the tasks that students eventually take on to fit into a total package where the parts fit well together, and where that package fits well with later life tasks. Which can justify a lot of coordination between the teaching of related topics, and between schools and those who manage life tasks. In addition, there are often scale and scope economies from having many students do similar tasks, especially regarding evaluation. (This coordination isn\u2019t obviously better when governments run schools.)Our simplest general task tool is inference, supported by related \u201cfacts\u201d. That is, one tells students about key facts related to a task class, and shows them examples of drawing relevant inferences from such facts. This \u201cbook learning\u201d is far from the only useful tool, but it is useful often enough to make fact-telling a big fraction of learning for most topics. Yes, it is somewhat possible to teach better general inference, but the scope for this seems vastly overrated.Not only is it hard to choose the package of learning tasks well, it is even harder for non-experts to judge the quality of such packages. And even when one can judge the quality of particular school tasks, their fitting together into large integrated packages makes it hard to push for particular changes. (Such as the long-overdue switch from geometry to statistics in high school.) If schools competed fiercely on measured student outcomes, they might try harder to find the best packages.

Maybe they just don\u2019t think the past is any guide to the future, at least in automation, making Mindell\u2019s discussion of the past irrelevant to the debate. I\u2019ve known people who think this way.But perhaps a more plausible interpretation is that on subjects like this in our intellectual world, usually there just is no \u201cdebate\u201d; there are just different sides who separately market their points of view. Just as in ordinary marketing, where firms usually pitch\u00a0their products without mentioning competing products, intellectuals marketing of points of view also usually ignore competing points of view. Instead of pointing out contrary arguments and rebutting them, intellectual usually prefer to ignore contrary arguments.This seems a sad state of affairs with respect to intellectual progress. But of course such progress is a public good, where individual contributions must trade a personal cost against a collective benefit, encouraging\u00a0each of us to free-ride on the efforts of others. We might create intellectual institutions that better encourage more engagement with and response to contrary arguments, but unless these are global institutions others may prefer to free-ride and not contribute to local institutions.You might think\u00a0that academic norms of discourse are\u00a0such global institutions encouraging engagement.

Why bother to work hard, if it makes little\u00a0difference to your chance of reward or punishment?There is a general principle here. As we add more noise to the measurement of relevant outcomes visible to the ultimate boss, the harder it is to use incentives tied to such outcomes to incentivize rowers.

But it can be hard to give lower\u00a0bosses good incentives, if higher bosses can\u2019t see well.Another problem is if the boss doesn\u2019t know just how hard each oarsman is capable of rowing. In this case most oarsmen get some slack, so that they aren\u2019t punished for not doing\u00a0more than they can. This is just one example of an \u201cinformation rent\u201d. In general, such rents come from any work-relevant info that the worker has that the boss can\u2019t see. If rowers need to synchronize their actions with each other or with waves or wind or time of day. If a\u00a0ship captain needs to choose the ship\u2019s route based info on weather and pirates. If a captain needs to treat different cargo differently in different conditions. If a\u00a0captain need to make judgements about whether to wait longer in port for more cargo.In general, when you want a worker to see some local condition, and then take an action that depends on that condition, you must pay some extra rent. So the more relevant info that workers get, the more choices they make, and the more that rides on those choices, the more workers gain in info rents.A related issue is the scope for sabotage. Angry resentful workers can seek hidden ways to hurt their bosses and ventures. So the more hard-to-detect ways workers have to hurt things, the more bosses\u00a0want to treat them well enough to avoid anger and resentment. Pained, sullen, or depressed workers can also hurt the mood of co-workers, suppliers, customers, and investors whom they contact. And the threat of pain can stress workers, making it harder for them to think clearly and well. These issues tend to argue against often using beatings and pain for motivation, even if such things allow stronger incentives by expanding the range of possible outcomes.Overall, these issues are bigger for more \u201ccomplex\u201d work, i.e., for more cognitive work, work that adapts more to diverse and new local conditions, and work in larger organizations. In the modern world, jobs have been getting more complex in these ways, and the organization and work literature I\u2019ve read suggests that finding good work incentives is a central problem in modern organizations, and that more complex work is a big reason why modern workplaces substitute broad incentives and good treatment for the detailed and harsh rules and monitoring more common in past eras.The literature I\u2019ve read on the economics of slavery also uses job complexity to explain the severity of treatment of slaves. Slaves in artisan jobs, in cities, and in households were treated better than field slaves, arguably because of job complexity. They were beaten less, and paid more, and might eventually buy their own freedom.Bryan Caplan has argued that ems would be treated harshly as slaves:Why wouldn\u2019t ems\u2019 creators use the threat of `physical hunger, exhaustion, pain, sickness, grime, hard labor, or sudden unexpected death\u2019 to motivate the ems?

You can\u2019t just look at one advantage of one feature and conclude that a feature is an advantage overall; you have to look at the net effect of that feature. Yes there are some advantages of\u00a0employees who don\u2019t talk back and never question orders. But there are obviously disadvantages as well. Sometimes you want workers to be creative, take the initiative, and to persuade and inspire others, and \u201crobot-like\u201d hardly seems best for these.I\u2019ve tried to look for data on overall effects:Our best data should be the most productive people in the world today, or that we\u2019ve seen in history. Yet the most productive people I know are not remotely \u201crobot-like\u201d, at least in the sense he describes above. Can Caplan name any specific workers, or groups, he knows that fit the bill? In writing the book I searched for literatures on work productivity, and used many dozens of articles on specific productivity correlates.

{"completion": " Imagine that you have a proposal for a better policy, to be used by governments, businesses, or other organizations. How can you get people to listen to your proposal, and perhaps endorse it or apply it? You might try to use personal connections to get an audience with someone at a government agency, political interest group, think tank, foundation, or business. But that\u2019s stuck in the private connection world. You might wait for an agency or foundation to put out an open call for proposals, seeking a solution to exactly the problem your proposal solves. But for any one proposal idea, you might wait a very long time.You might submit an article to an open conference or journal, or submit a book to a publisher. But if they accept your submission, that mostly won\u2019t be an endorsement of whether your proposal is good policy by some metric. Publishers are mostly looking at other criteria, such as whether you have an impressive study using difficult methods, or whether you have a book thesis and writing style that will attract many readers.So I propose that we consider creating an open process for submitting policy proposals to be evaluated, in the hope of gaining some level of endorsement and perhaps further action. This process won\u2019t judge your submission on wit, popularity, impressiveness, or analytical rigor. Their key question is: is this promising as a policy proposal to actually adopt, for the purpose of making a better world? If they endorse your proposal, then other actors can use that as a quality signal regarding what policy proposals to consider.Of course how you judge a policy proposal depends on your values. So there might be different open policy evaluators (OPE) based on different sets of values. Each OPE needs to have some consistent standards by which they evaluate proposals. For example, economists might ask whether a proposal improves economic efficiency, libertarians might ask if it increases liberty, and progressives might ask whether it reduces inequality.Should the evaluation of a proposal consider whether there\u2019s a snowball chance in hell of a proposal being actually adopted, or even officially considered? That is, whether it is in the \u201cOverton window\u201d? Should they consider whether you have so far gained sufficient celebrity endorsements to make people pay attention to your proposal? Well, those are choices of evaluation criteria. I\u2019m personally more interested in evaluating proposals regardless of who has supported them, and regardless of their near-term political feasibility. Like how academics say we do today with journal article submissions. But that\u2019s just me.An OPE seems valid and useful as long as its actual choices of which policies it endorses match its declared evaluation criteria. Then it can serve as a useful filter, between people with innovative policy ideas and policy customers seeking useful ideas to consider and perhaps implement. If you can find OPEs who share your evaluation criteria, you can consider the policies they endorse. And of course if we ever end up having many of them, you could focus first on the most prestigious ones.Ideally an OPE would have funding from some source to pay for its evaluations. But I could also imagine applicants having to pay a fee to have their proposals considered.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: November 27, 2018 8:15 pm \nTitle: Open Policy Evaluation\nHypocrisy is a tribute vice pays to virtue.

{"completion": " On Shulman\u2019s more concrete argument, his suggested single-version approach to em value sharing, wherein a single central em only allows (perhaps vast numbers of) brief copies, can suffer from greatly reduced innovation. When em copies are assigned to and adapt to different tasks, there may be no easy way to merge their minds into a single common mind containing all their adaptations. The single em copy that is best at doing an average of tasks, may be much worse at each task than the best em for that task.Shulman\u2019s other concrete suggestion for sharing em values is \u201cpsychological testing, staged situations, and direct observation of their emulation software to form clear pictures of their loyalties.\u201d But genetic and cultural evolution has long tried to make human minds fit well within strongly loyal teams, a task to which we seem well adapted. This suggests that moving our minds closer to a \u201cborg\u201d team ideal would cost us somewhere else, such as in our mental agility.On the concrete coordination gains that Shulman sees from superorganism ems, most of these gains seem cheaply achievable via simple long-standard human coordination mechanisms: property rights, contracts, and trade. Individual farmers have long faced starvation if they could not extract enough food from their property, and farmers were often out-competed by others who used resources more efficiently.With ems there is the added advantage that em copies can agree to the \u201cterms\u201d of their life deals before they are created. An em would agree that it starts life with certain resources, and that life will end when it can no longer pay to live. Yes there would be some selection for humans and ems who peacefully accept such deals, but probably much less than needed to get loyal devotion to and shared values with a superorganism.Yes, with high value sharing ems might be less tempted to steal from other copies of themselves to survive. But this hardly implies that such ems no longer need property rights enforced. They\u2019d need property rights to prevent theft by copies of other ems, including being enslaved by them.  Once a property rights system exists, the additional cost of applying it within a set of em copies seems small relative to the likely costs of strong value sharing.Shulman seems to argue both that superorganisms are a natural endpoint of evolution, and that ems are especially supportive of superorganisms. But at most he has shown that ems organizations may be at a somewhat larger scale, not that they would reach civilization-encompassing scales. In general, creatures who share values can indeed coordinate better, but perhaps not by much, and it can be costly to achieve and maintain shared values. I see no coordinate-by-values free lunch.I am again glad to see Carl Shulman engage the important issue of social change given whole brain emulation, but I fear the Singularity Institute obsession with making a god to rule us all (well) had distracted him from thinking about real em life, as opposed to how ems might realize make-a-god hopes.Added 8a: To be clear, in a software-like em labor market, there will be some natural efficient scale of training, where all the workers doing some range of tasks are all copies of the same intensely trained em. All those ems will naturally find it easier to coordinate on values, and can coordinate a bit better because of that fact. There\u2019s just no particular reason to expect that to lead to much more coordination on larger scales.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "On the generic costs of value sharing, I think Shulman\u2019s intuition is that a mind\u2019s values can be expressed in a relatively small static file.

{"completion": " A length of this tube about twice Earth\u2019s circumference would have about the same surface area as Earth. Imagine that an area of this size held a mix of land and water similar to Earth\u2019s continents. Imagine also that more such clusters of continents are spread all along this tube, spaced roughly twenty Earth circumferences apart. In between is mostly open ocean, with a few small islands.The tube slowly gets colder millions of km from its center, as those places are further from it sun. Life is spread all along the tube, but so far humans and civilization have only evolved on one near-center cluster of continents. It would take an old style (~12 knot) sailing ship about 4 years to travel in a straight line from one cluster to another, and it would take a jet airliner about 40 days to fly there. Both would need refueling along the way.My big question here is: how would history, and economic growth, have played out differently on Tube Earth? With all that land out there to colonize, how much more activity would be dedicated to spreading out across the tube? How far would be the furthest flag, subsistence farming town, and modern industrial city at any one time?My guess is that Tube Earth would look a lot more like our Earth than most space colonization fans expect. Explorers would not have even reached the nearest other continent cluster until the 1800s, and even now there\u2019d be only a few small colonizes there, mostly practicing subsistence agriculture. A several year shipping time would make it very expensive to import modern equipment, and greatly discourage the shipping of mining minerals or farmed food back to the central cluster. Mostly they\u2019d work harder to get more minerals and food from nearby mines and farms.By 2010 Tube Earth would be lucky to have one monthly airline flight to the next cluster, and a very expensive but welcomed internet connection. Lots of stories would take place there, and it would offer an escape for well-off religious or political refuges. But overall it wouldn\u2019t matter much, because of its huge transport costs.The key point to note here is that other continent clusters on a Tube Earth are vastly more hospitable and easier to reach than the nearest asteroids or the Moon are from Earth. And the rest of the solar system is even worse. So if other continent clusters would by now matter little for a Tube Earth, asteroids aren\u2019t going to matter much on Earth for a long time to come.Added: Karl Smith calls it \u201cInvest for Prestige/Get Conned\u201d\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: April 25, 2012 4:20 pm \nTitle: Tube Earth Econ\nImagine someone plans to build a gas station far out in an isolated desert.

I can see variations on [this method] being used much more widely to generate standard safe answers that people can adopt with less fear of seeming strange or ignorant. But those who actually want to find true answers even when such answers are contrarian, they will need something closer to prediction markets.In a new mechanism\u00a0by Yuqing Kong,\u00a0N agents simultaneously and without communication give answers to T questions, each of which has C possible answers. The clues that agents have about each question can be arbitrarily correlated, and agents can have differing priors about that clue distribution. However, clues must be identically and independently distributed (IID) across questions.\u00a0If T \u2265 2C and N \u2265 2, then in this new mechanism telling the \u201ctruth\u201d (i.e., answer indicated by clue) is a dominant strategy, with a strictly higher payoff if anyone else also tells the truth!This is a substantial advance over the prior literature, and\u00a0I expect future mechanisms to weaken the IID across questions constraint. Alas, even so this seems to suffer for the same key problem of needing truth to be the cheapest way for respondents to coordinate answers. I expect this problem to be much harder to overcome.Of course if you add \u201ctruth speakers\u201d as some of the agents, and wait for those speakers\u2019 input before paying the other participants, you get something much closer to a prediction market.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: November 15, 2019 12:40 pm \nTitle: A New Truth Mechanism\n\n###\n\n"}

{"completion": " All else equal, drivers with twice the wages tend to put twice the dollar value on both saving an other minute of driving, and also on preventing another small chance of their own death. So if the dollar amounts of their speeding tickets and liability given an accident were also twice as large, then the dollar amounts on both sides of their tradeoff would all be twice as large. Thus in the same circumstances they would make the same choices to trade time versus the chance of an accident. So in the same car on the same road etc., they\u2019d drive the same speed, and take the same time to check before turning or changing lanes.However, having two drivers, one with twice the wage of the other, each take the same amount of time to use the same technology to prevent the same amount of harm to others is not efficient. That\u2019s wasteful, just like having a high-wage donor work the line at a soup kitchen, instead of working at their high-wage job a bit more to pay a low-wage worker to work that soup kitchen line. In the driving case, we can keep the car accident rate the same and make both drivers better off, if we have the lower wage person drive more carefully, the higher wage person drive less carefully, and have the high wage person pay the lower some cash.For example, the median US wage is now ~$16/hr, and workers tend to value commuting time at about half of their wage rate. So imagine that drivers A and B value each their driving time at $9/hr and $18/hr respectively, which is one and two pennies per four seconds. In this case both A and B can be\u00a0better off, while the total accident rate stays the same, if B gains 1.0 pennies by putting in 2 fewer seconds, A loses 0.5 pennies by putting in 2 more seconds, and B pays A 0.75 pennies.In general, we use traffic fines and accident liability to buy the time of drivers\u2019 to prevent more accidents. Day-fines proportional to income buy the same amount of time from all drivers in similar circumstances. But we can be better off if we instead buy more time from drivers with lower wages, and less time from drivers with higher wages. And roughly the right amount of time is induced from each via fines and liability that do not vary with income.You might complain that ordinary constant fines, that do not vary with income, do not include a cash transfer from high to low wage drivers. But that critique only makes sense if we currently had day-fines, and I was proposing to switch to constant fines. In fact constant fines are our status quo, which I\u2019m proposing that we keep. I don\u2019t see we should need transfers to reject an inefficient change and keep things the same.Note that a similar argument also says it is inefficient to give the same jail time sentence to high and low wage convicts. Jail is the least efficient of all known forms of punishment, and equal duration sentences just makes this worse. We should instead delegate punishment choices to\u00a0vouchers.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: February 5, 2022 9:00 am \nTitle: Against Day Fines\nToday, more than 30 European and Latin American countries levy penalties using an income-graduated, or \u201cday fine,\u201d model.

{"completion": " I\u2019ve long been intrigued by the idea of private law, wherein people can stay in the same place but\u00a0contract with different legal systems, which then set the rules regarding their legal interactions with others. Such rules might in effect change the laws of tort, crime, marriage, etc. that people\u00a0live under. And so such competition between private laws might push the law to\u00a0evolve toward more efficient laws.One of the things that legal systems tend to do is to protect people from mistakes. For example, contract law won\u2019t enforce contracts it sees as mistakes, and it fills in contract holes it sees resulting from laziness. Law is often DWIM law. Which can be great when you trust your\u00a0law to choose well. But if one is to have an effective choice of private law, and real competition for that role, then one\u2019s current law shouldn\u2019t be able to overrule one\u2019s choice of a new law. Instead, one\u2019s choice of a private legal\u00a0system, like one\u2019s choice of nation, needs to\u00a0be a simple clear choice where one is not much protected from mistakes.Today we don\u2019t in fact have such private law, because our standard legal system won\u2019t enforce contracts we sign that declare our intent to use different legal systems. To achieve private law, we\u2019d need to change this key feature of our standard legal system.Your choice to change nations, either for temporary travel or for permanent moves, can be a big mistake. It might result from temporary mood fluctuations, or from misunderstandings about the old nation or the new. Nevertheless we have little regulation of such choices. Instead individuals are mostly fully exposes to their possible mistakes. For example, while Europe is heavily regulated in general, European teens today can decide to go join ISIS, even when many others greatly regret such choices. We\u00a0disapprove of nations that prevent people from leaving because that cuts\u00a0competition between nations to serve people.Similarly, if we want completion between legal systems without forcing people to move, we\u2019ll have to change our law to accept our not protecting people from bad choices of legal systems. There will have to be a simple clear act by which one chooses a law, a choice not much subject to legal review and reversal. We\u2019d want to encourage people to take such choices seriously, but then to accept the choices they make. Freedom of choice requires a\u00a0freedom to make mistakes.

If so, why not make it the best it can be? The result is the book you now hold. It has over 42% more citations, and 18% more words, but it is only a bit easier to read.

I mostly argued that we have a huge literature on economic growth at odds with this. Historically, the vast majority of innovation has been small, incremental, and spread across many industries and locations. Yes, humans mostly displaced other pre-human species, as such species can\u2019t share innovations well. But since then sharing and complementing of innovations has allowed most of the world to gain from even the biggest lumpiest innovations ever seen.

I mostly argued that we have a huge literature on economic growth at odds with this. Historically, the vast majority of innovation has been small, incremental, and spread across many industries and locations. Yes, humans mostly displaced other pre-human species, as such species can\u2019t share innovations well. But since then sharing and complementing of innovations has allowed most of the world to gain from even the biggest lumpiest innovations ever seen. Eliezer said a deep conceptual analysis allowed him to see that this time is different.Since then there\u2019s been a vast increase in folks concerned about AI risk, many focused on scenarios like Yudkowsky\u2019s. (But almost no interest in my critique.) In recent years I\u2019ve heard many say they are now less worried about foom, but have new worries just as serious. Though I\u2019ve found it hard to understand what worries could justify big efforts now, compared to later when we should know far more about powerful AI details. (E.g., worrying about cars, TV, or nukes in the year 1000 would have been way too early.)Enter Paul Christiano (see also Vox summary). Paul says:The stereotyped image of AI catastrophe is a powerful, malicious AI system that takes its creators by surprise and quickly achieves a decisive advantage over the rest of humanity. I think this is probably not what failure will look like, and I want to try to paint a more realistic picture. \u2026\n\n###\n\n"}
{"completion": " It is easy to believe that agent rents and failures generally scale roughly with the overall important and magnitude of activities. That is, when we do twice as much, and get roughly twice as much value out of it, we also lose about twice as much potential via agency failures, relative to a perfect agency relation, and the agents gain about twice as much in agency rents. So it is plausible to think that this also happens with AIs as they become more capable; we get more but then so do they, and more potential is lost.Christiano instead fears that as AIs get more capable, the AIs will gain so much more agency rents, and we will suffer so much more due to agency failures, that we will actually become worse off as as result. And not just a bit worse off; we apparently get apocalypse level worse off! This sort of agency apocalypse is not only a far larger problem than we\u2019d expect via simple scaling, it is also not supported anywhere I know of in the large academic literature on agency problems.This literature has found many factors that influence the difficulty of agency relations. Agency tends to be harder when more relevant agent info and actions are hidden both to principals and other agents, when info about outcomes get noisier, when there is more noise in the mapping between effort and outcomes, when agents and principals are more impatient and risk averse, when agents are more unique, when principals can threaten more extreme outcomes, and when agents can more easily coordinate.But this literature has not found that smarter agents are more problematic, all else equal. In fact, the economics literature that models agency problems typically assumes perfectly rational and thus infinitely smart agents, who reason exactly correctly in every possible situation. This typically results in limited and modest agency rents and failures.For concreteness, imagine a twelve year old rich kid, perhaps a king or queen, seeking agents to help manage their wealth or kingdom. It is far from obvious that this child is on average worse off when they choose a smarter more capable agent, or when the overall pool of agents from which they can choose becomes smarter and more capable. And its even less obvious that the kid becomes maximally worse off as their agents get maximally smart and capable. In fact, I suspect the opposite.Of course it remains possible that there is something special about the human-AI agency relation that can justify Christiano\u2019s claims. But surely the burden of \u201cproof\u201d (really argument) should lie on those say this case is radically different from most found in our large and robust agency literatures. (Google Scholar lists 234K papers with keyword \u201cprincipal-agent\u201d.)And even if AI agency problems turn out to be unusual severe, that still doesn\u2019t justify trying to solve them so far in advance of knowing about their details.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "If I want to convince Bob to vote for Alice, I can experiment with many different persuasion strategies \u2026 Or I can build good predictive models of Bob\u2019s behavior \u2026 These are powerful techniques for achieving any goal that can be easily measured over short time periods.

{"completion": " Which brings us to the topic of recent progress in machine learning. Google just announced its PaLM system, which fit 540 billion parameters to a \u201chigh-quality corpus of 780 billion tokens that represent a wide range of natural language use cases\u201d, in order to predict from past words the next words appropriate for a wide range of small language tasks. Its performance is impressive; it does well compared to humans on a wide range of such tasks. And yet it still basically \u201cbabbles\u201c; it seems not remotely up to the task of thinking together with a human. If you talked with it for a long time, you might well find ways that it could help you. But still, it wouldn\u2019t think with you.Maybe this problem will be solved by just adding more parameters and data. But I doubt it. I expect that a bigger problem is that such systems have been training at these small language tasks, instead of at the more fundamental task of thinking together. Yes, most of the language data on which they are built is from conversations where humans were thinking together. So they can learn well to say the next small thing in such a conversation. But they seem to be failing to infer the deeper structures that support shared thinking among humans.It might help to assign such a system the task of \u201cuseful inner monologue\u201d. That is, it would start talking to itself, and keep talking indefinitely, continually updating its representations from the data of its internal monologue. The trick would be to generate these monologues and do this update so that the resulting system got better at doing other useful tasks. (I don\u2019t know how to arrange this.) While versions of this approach have been tried before, the fact that this isn\u2019t the usual approach suggests that it doesn\u2019t now produce gains as fast, at least for doing these small language tasks. Even so, if those are misleading metrics, this approach might help more to get real progress at artificial thinking.I will sit up and take notice when the main improvements to systems with\u00a0impressive broad language abilities come from such inner monologues, or from thinking together on other useful tasks. That will look more like systems that have learned how to think. And when such abilities work across a wide scope of topics, that will look to me more like the proverbial \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d. But I still don\u2019t expect to see that for a long time.

{"completion": " Compared to an asexually reproducing cell, the child of a sexual cell differs more from its parents. In Eukaryote cells, different parts reproduce separately, and so are only like the matching parts of their parents, and less like other parts. In a multi-cellular organism, most of the cells differ a lot more from the stem cells from which they start, which were made by parent stem cells. So if we focus on individual cells, then most cells in such a creature seem more artificial. It is only when we look at the entire organism that we can see it as relatively organic.Thus how \u201cself made\u201d something is depends on how we divide it from its environment, and on what size units we consider. Evolutionary progress has consisted in substantial part of moving to larger self-made units, where their parts are less self-made. How artificial something looks should also depend on the timescale we pick, and on our diversity reference. Things look more self-made on short timescales, relative to long, as distant ancestors may be quite different. And things look more self-made the wider the variety of other creatures to which we compare them, as parent-child differences will loom less large then.Once humans developed culture, our behaviors were less made by our parents, and more by a larger culture from which we learned. Isolated groups of humans together with their cultures were relatively organic. But as our world has become more integrated, we are made less by local associates and more by the entire world culture.For example, an individual firm that tries to be profit maximizing is \u201cmade\u201d to some degree by its investors, designers, producers, managers, suppliers, and customers, all of whom are watching the entire world for ideas on more efficient ways to do things. Such a firm is \u201clike\u201d the prior firms associated with such people mainly because the prior experiences of they or their ancestors shaped their sunk investments, expectations and understandings. To a substantial degree, it is the entire world economy that is \u201cself-made\u201d, with each firm being much less so. Firms are more artificial, but the whole economy is more organic.But even so, there are still identifiable smaller units that are \u201cself-made\u201d to important degrees. Individuals, firms, and nations, among other units, \u201cown\u201d and control resources that they use to promote the future prosperity of \u201ctheir\u201d future units. Especially their investors.Governance processes are justified in terms of promoting the future of the units they govern, but internal sub-units are often rightly suspicious that such processes are used by rival units to gain relative advantages over them. Governed units become less \u201cself-made\u201d, which carries substantial risks. Competition between larger units can restrain such internal predation via governance, but competition would not restrain a world government.Someday humans will probably create artificial creatures who are fully capable of cheaply doing all the tasks needed in their future economy. These creatures are likely to differ more from humans than from the creatures that they make to follow them. So relatively \u201cself made\u201d humanity will \u201cartificially\u201d make new creatures who then more \u201cself make\u201d their new world. But each particular new creature will be much less \u201cself made\u201d, and thus more \u201cartificial\u201d, as it will be made more by its entire civilization.Okay, while this concept of \u201cself-made\u201d depends on units and timescale, it still seems useful for discussing how future life should be more \u201cartificial\u201d. Life will in general be less self-made on smaller unit scales, even if still self-made on an entire civilization scale. And after alien civilizations meet each other, even they may become less self-made.Added Jun18: I had this related conversation on Twitter with the author of Natural: How Faith in Nature\u2019s Goodness Leads to Harmful Fads, Unjust Laws, and Flawed Science.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: June 17, 2021 1:20 pm \nTitle: \u201cArtificial\u201d = Not-Self-Made?\nRecently I\u2019ve said that it seems obvious that our descendants will soon be artificial, as will be any advanced aliens we meet.

Yes, people doing other things sometimes stumble on a new answer, but in general it helps to be looking in order to find.I also know lots of academics, and they all have one or more research topics. And if you ask them they can usually phrase these topics in terms of questions they want to answer. And this is a big part of what makes academics more intellectually productive. But alas, few academics are able to articulate in much detail why it is important to the world that their questions get answered. They usually just invoke some vague associations, apparently considering it sufficient that some journal is willing to publish their answers. They seem to think it is someone else\u2019s job to decide what questions are important. Unfortunately, most academic journal articles are answering pretty uninteresting questions.\n\n###\n\n"}

These theaters are perhaps entertaining and interesting in their own right, as a sort of performance art, but are not of much interest or value to people who are interested in the future in the form it might arrive in, for all.It is easy to make the distinction explicit. Most futurists are interested in the future beyond the [manufactured normalcy field]. I am primarily interested in the future once it enters the Field, and the process by which it gets integrated into it. This is also where the future turns into money, so perhaps my motivations are less intellectual than they are narrowly mercenary. \u2026This also explains why so few futurists make any money. They are attracted to exactly those parts of the future that are worth very little. They find visions of changed human behavior stimulating. Technological change serves as a basis for constructing aspirational visions of changed humanity.

While the norm system may be designed to on average produce good outcomes, when that system breaks then each individual has only weak incentives to fix it. They mainly seek to avoid blame according to the current broken system. In this post I\u2019ll discuss an especially disturbing example, via a series of four hypothetical scenarios.1. First, imagine we had a tech that could turn ordinary humans into productive zombies. Such zombies can still do most jobs effectively, but they no longer have feelings or an inner life, and from the outside they also seem dead inside, lacking passion, humor, and liveliness. Imagine that someone proposed to use this tech on a substantial fraction of the human population. That is, they propose to zombify those who do jobs that others see as boring, routine, and low status, like collecting garbage, cleaning bedpans, or sweeping floors. As in this scenario living people would be turned into dead zombies, this proposal would probably be widely seen as genocide, and soundly rejected.2. Second, imagine someone else proposes the following variation: when a new child of a parent seems likely enough to grow up to take such a low status job, this zombie tech is applied very early to the fetus. So no non-zombie humans are killed, they are just prevented from existing. Zombie kids are able to learn and eventually learn to do those low status.

That is, each birth to low status parents is now of identical twins, one of which is an ordinary kid, and the other is a zombie kid. If parent\u2019s don\u2019t want to raise zombie kids, some other organization will take over that task. So now the parents get to have all their usual lively kids, and the world gains a bunch of extra zombie kids who grow up to do low status jobs. Some may support this proposal, but surely many others will find it creepy. I expect that it would be pretty hard to create a political consensus to support this proposal.While in the first scenario people were killed, and in the second scenario parents were deprived, this third scenario is designed to take away these problems. But this third proposal still has two remaining problems. First, if we have a choice between creating an empty zombie and a living feeling person who finds their life worth living, this second option seems to result in a better world. Which argues against zombies. Second, if zombies seem like monsters, supporters of this proposal might might be blamed for creating monsters. And as the zombies look a lot like humans, many will see you as a bad person if you seem inclined to or capable of treating them badly. It looks bad to be willing to create a lower class, and to treat them like a disrespected lower class, if that lower class looks a lot like humans. So by supporting this third proposal, you risk being blamed.4. My fourth and last scenario is designed to split apart these two problems with the third scenario, to make you choose which problem you care more about. Imagine that robots are going to take over most all human jobs, but that we have a choice about which kind of robot they are. We could choose human-like robots, who act lively with passion and humor, and who inside have feelings and an inner life. Or we could choose machine-like robots, who are empty inside and also look empty on the outside, without passion, humor, etc.If you are focused on creating a better world, you\u2019ll probably prefer the human-like robots, as that which choice results in more creatures who find their lives worth living. But if you are focused on avoiding blame, you\u2019ll probably prefer the machine-like robots, as few will blame you for for that choice. In that choice the creatures you create look so little like humans that few will blame you for creating such creatures, or for treating them badly.I recently ran a 24 hour poll on Twitter about this choice, a poll to which 700 people responded. Of those who make a choice, 77% picked the machine-like robots:\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: November 7, 2018 7:30 pm \nTitle: Avoiding Blame By Preventing Life\nIf morality is basically a package of norms, and if norms are systems for making people behave, then each individual\u2019s main moral priority becomes: to avoid blame.

In the rest of this post, I\u2019ll respond.I am agnostic on whether journal quality should remain as a signal of article quality. If that signal goes away, then we are talking about what other signals can be how useful. And if that signal remains, then we can be talking about other signals that might be used by journals to make their decisions, and also by other observers to evaluate article quality. But whatever signals are used, I\u2019m pretty sure that most observers will demand that a few simple easy-to-interpret signals be distilled from the many complex signals available. Tenure review committees, for example, will need signals nearly as simple as journal prestige.Let me also point out that these two approaches of market odds or author bets can also be applied to non-academic articles, such as news articles, and also to many other kinds of quality signals. For example, we could have author or market bets on how many future citations or how much news coverage an article will get, whether any contained math proofs will be shown to be in error, whether any names or dates will be shown to have been misreported in the article, or whether coding errors will be found in supporting statistical analysis. Judges or committees might also evaluate overall article quality at some distant future date. Bets on any of these could be conditional on whether serious attempts were made in that category.Now, on the comparison between author and market bets, an obvious alternative is to offer both author bets and market odds as signals, either to ultimate readers or to journals reviewing articles. After all, it is hard to justify suppressing any potentially useful signal. If a market exists, authors could easily make betting offers via that market, and those offers could easily be flagged for market observers to take as signals.I see market odds as easier for observers to interpret than author bet offers. First, authors bets are more easily corrupted via authors arranging for a collaborating shill to accept their bet. Second, it can be hard for observers to judge how author risk-aversion influences author odds, and how replication costs and author wealth influences author bet amounts. For market odds, in contrast, amounts take care of themselves via opposing bets, and observers need only judge any overall differences in wealth and risk-aversion between the two sides, differences that tend to be smaller, vary less, and matter less for market odds.Also, authors would usually participate in any open market on their paper, giving those authors bet incentives and making market odds include their info. The reason authors will bet is that\u00a0other participants will expect authors to bet to puff up their odds, and so other participants will push the odds down to compensate. So if authors don\u2019t in fact participate, the odds will tend to look bad for them.

But in an open market, anyone could offer to bet on any of those metrics. So an open market could show estimates regarding any metric for which anyone made an offer to bet. This allows a much larger range of quality metrics to be available under the market odds approach.While the simple market approach merely bets conditional on someone attempting a replication attempt, an audit lottery variation that I\u2019ve proposed would instead use a small fixed percentage of amounts bet to pay for replication attempts. If the amount collected is insufficient, then it and all betting amounts are gambled so that either a sufficient amount is created, or all these assets disappear.Just as 5% significance is treated as a threshold today for publication evaluation, I can imagine particular bet reliability thresholds being important for evaluating article quality. News articles might even be filtered or show simple icons based on a reliability category. In this case the betting offer and market options would more tend to merge.For example, an article might be considered \u201cgood enough\u201d if it had no more than a 5% chance of being wrong, if checked. The standard for checking this might be if anyone was currently offering to bet at 19-1 odds in favor of reliability. For as long as the author or anyone else maintained such offers, the article would qualify as at least that reliable, and so could be shown via filters or icons as meeting that standard.

{"completion": " One usual story is that the manager of the new merged firm just can\u2019t help interfering with and inter-connecting these divisions. After all, he or she has career ambitions which are poorly served by a complete hands-off management style. But after such manager \u201chelp\u201d, it becomes harder to evaluate the performance of each division independently from the rest. And the quality of the people wiling to work as heads of these divisions, instead of as CEOs of them as independent firms, gets lower. These costs of size are said to be larger than the benefits to be found from exploiting synergies, which is why firms are not larger.A similar thing happens with government agencies assigned to manage sectors of society. Imagine that we created a government agency in charge of food for the whole nation. This agency is given an authorization so broad that it could allow exactly the existing food practice and industries, such as farms, grocery stores, restaurants, and personal kitchens. Or it could completely nationalize all these resources, and use tax revenue to reorganize them as it saw fit. Or it could do anything in between. Imagine that such an agency had been created in the U.S. in 1970.It seems obvious to me that by now such a food agency would have intervened in food production, processing, and distribution far more extensively that has been the case in our actual history. Large government agencies would have formed with many thousands of employees, many of them directly managing food activities. Everyone would get access to some food, and some government activities would achieve larger scale economies than seen in the private sector. But this would be achieved in part via more uniformity, standardization, and stability of food processes. Government managed food would end up with less variety and adaptation to individual circumstances and preferences, and this food would improve and innovate less over time.The amazing thing is that all this would happen even with high quality oversight and accountability by agencies to politicians, and politicians to voters. Voters would tell politicians about things they liked more and less, politicians would pass on these messages to agencies, and agencies would often change their policies and strategies in the suggested directions. But even in the absence of much corruption, civil servant selfishness, or partisan rancor, and even with the best political processes that we can imagine, a food industry managed by a government agency with broad powers would still probably end up creating a worse world of food over the long run.Similarly, a new firm that merged three random prior firms would typically earn less profits, even with the sincere and helpful advice of its investors, boards of advisors, and management consulting firms, and even in the absence of stupid or corrupt firm managers and advisors. Processes of governance and oversight can and do help, but they are generally insufficient to cancel the harms from an overly centralized organization structure.These patterns, if true, are seem important regarding the ideal scales of both business and government. And I fear the U.S. public is insufficiently aware of them, as we seem to be on the verge of a historic increase in the scale and depth of government management of society.Added 4Oct: Let me emphasize that what I\u2019m describing is theoretically puzzling, in that it isn\u2019t very directly implied by our standard models of profit maximization or democratic accountability.

{"completion": " All of this suggests that you be wary of simply asking your intuition for opinions about what you or anyone else should do in strange distant futures. Especially regarding moral and collective choices. Your intuition may dutifully generate such opinions, but they\u2019ll probably depend a lot on how the questions were framed, and the context in which questions were asked. For more reliable opinions, try instead to chip away at such topics.However, this context-dependence is gold to those who seek to influence others\u2019 opinions. Warriors attack where an enemy is weak. When seeking to convert others to a point of view, you can have only limited influence on topics where they have accepted a particular framing, and have incentives to be careful. But you can more influence how a new topic is framed, and when there are many new topics you can emphasize the few where your preferred framing helps more.So legal advocates want to control how courts pick cases to review and the new precedents they set. Political advocates want to influence which news stories get\u00a0popular and how those stories are framed. Political advocates also seek to influence the choices and interpretations of cultural icons like songs and movies, because being less constrained\u00a0by\u00a0facts such things are more open to framing.As with the example above of future college choices, distant future choices are less thoughtful or stable, and thus more subject to selection and framing effects. Future moral choices are even less stable, and more related to political positions that advocates want to push. And future moral choices expressed via culture like movies are even more flexible, and thus more useful. So newly-discussed culturally-expressed distant future collective moral choices create a perfect storm of random context-dependent unreliable opinions, and thus are\u00a0ideal for advocacy influence, at least when you can get people to pay attention to them.Of course most people are usually reluctant to think much about distant future choices, including moral and collective ones. Which greatly limits the value of such\u00a0topics to advocates. But a few choices related to distant futures have engaged wider audiences, such as climate change and, recently, AI risk. And political advocates do seem quite eager to influence such topics, due to their potency. They\u00a0seem select such topics from a far larger set of similarly important issues, in part for their potency at pushing common political positions. The science-fiction truism really does seem to apply: most talk on\u00a0the distant future is really indirect talk on\u00a0our world today.Of course the future really will happen eventually, and we should want to consider choices today that importantly influence that future, some of those choices will have moral and collective aspects, some of these issues can be expressed via culture like movies, and at some point such issue discussion will be new. But as with big hard problems in general, it is probably better to chip away at such problems.That is: Anchor your thoughts to reality rather than to fiction. Make sure you have a grip on current and past behavior before looking at related future behavior. Try to stick with analyzing facts for longer before being forced to make value choices. Think about amoral and decentralized choices carefully before considering moral and collective ones. Avoid feeling pressured to jump to strong conclusions on recently popular topics. Prefer robust and reliable methods even when they are less easy and direct. Mostly the distant future doesn\u2019t need action today \u2013 decisions will wait a bit for us to\u00a0think more carefully.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: December 11, 2016 11:45 am \nTitle: Beware Futurism As Political Allegory\nImagine that you are junior in high school who expects to attend college.

Your story person\u2019s life is just the opposite. You the author must never duck trouble \u2026 Because fiction is make-believe, it has to be more logical than real life if it is to be believed. In real life, things may occur for no apparent reason. But in fiction you the writer simply cannot ever afford to lose sight of logic and let things happen for no apparent reason. \u2026In real life, coincidence happens all the time. But in fiction \u2013 especially when the coincidence helps the character be at the right place at the right time, or overhear the crucial telephone conversation, or something similar -coincidence is deadly. Your readers will refuse to believe it. \u2026Your character must have an immediate, physical cause for what he does. This immediate stimulus cannot be merely a thought inside his head; for readers to believe many transactions, they have to be shown a stimulus to action that is outside of the character-some kind of specific prod that is onstage right now. Turning this around, it\u2019s equally true that if you start by showing a stimulus, then you can\u2019t simply ignore it; you must show a response. \u2026 In real life, you might get a random thought for no apparent reason, and as a consequence do or say something.

Sometimes, without realizing it, they let their characters talk on and on, boringly, becoming windbags. \u2026 The great majority of your characters have to be more terse and logical than we often are in real life, if the dialogue on the page is to appear realistic. \u2026 whenever possible, set up your dialogue scenes so that they play out \u201cone-on-one\u201d, getting rid of other characters (who might interrupt and make the conversation more complicated). \u2026 Simplicity\u2026 directness\u2026 goal orientation\u2026 brevity.

{"completion": " In English practice, [blackmail] utterances were routinely handled as criminal matters. \u2026 The ordinary remedy \u2026 seems to have been something like a common-law equivalent of the canonical orders to keep silence: requiring the offender to enter a bond to keep the peace. The higher courts at Westminster, by contrast, seem to have become involved only in enforcing the statutes Scandalum magnatum, in which great men of the realm sought redress against their detractors. \u2026 For Coke [who died in 1634] it was \u2018\u2018not material\u2019\u2019 whether the words were true or false. The potential danger to public order and harm to the individual defamed by the revelation of shameful conduct were what counted.

He notes that \u201cthe blackmail statutes began to appear roughly about the same time and with the same underlying ethos as the other laws that made up the Victorian compromise.\u201d (p. 99). A similar point is made in Angus McLaren\u2019s book-length account of blackmail, Sexual Blackmail: A Modern History (2002). McLaren observes that courts would ignore the truth or falsity of the blackmailer\u2019s accusations, which, if true, would often mean that the blackmail victim had engaged in serious criminal conduct.

{"completion": " I\u2019ve previously suggested that people choose health agents, who pay for and choose medicine but who lose lots of money if their clients become disabled, in pain, or die. I\u2019ve also suggested that people choose crime vouchers, who must pay for cash fines when their clients are found guilty of crimes, but who have client-voucher contracts able to set client co-liability and to choose punishments and freedoms of association, movement, and privacy. I\u2019ve also suggested having agents who insure you against hard times, career agents who get some fraction of your future income, and that parents get such a fraction to compensate for raising you.So as a man with all these hammers staring at this tough nail of drug overdoses, I\u2019m tempted to merge them into one big hammer and take a swing. That is, how would a merged agent who had all these incentives try to deal with a potential drug problem?Imagine a for-profit experienced expert org approved by the client\u2019s parents when they are a kid, or by the client when they are adult. In a world with with few legal constraints on the contracts that this agent can agree to with clients. An org who probably also represents many of this client\u2019s friends and family. An org who gains from client income, but who must pay when a client is found guilty of a crime, or suffers hard times, pain, disability, or death. An org able to limit client freedoms of privacy, movement, and association, And able to set client punishments for verified events, and to make associated clients co-liable, so that they are all punished together re events involving any one of them.Such an agent might make sure to get addicts a reliable drug supply, or to have overdose drugs readily available. Or they might forbid clients from mixing with drug types. Or they might test clients regularly, or encourage althetics that conflict with drug use. Or any of a thousand other possible approaches. The whole point is that I don\u2019t have to figure that out; it would be their job to figure out what works.Now if an org with incentives and powers like that can\u2019t find a way to get clients to avoid becoming drug addicts, or to not overdose if they do, then that would probably either be due to some larger social context that they couldn\u2019t change, or because many individuals just like drugs so much that they are willing to take substantial chances of overdosing.What if a larger social policy related to drugs or users was a key problem? For example, maybe drug laws are too strict, or too lax. If so, I\u2019d expect these orgs to figure out which and lobby for changes. And given their expertise and incentives, I\u2019d be tempted to listen to them. If you didn\u2019t trust them so much, well then you might consider using futarchy to choose. But honestly I expect such combined agents could handle the problem regardless of larger policies.In sum, I suggest that the key underlying problem with drug overdoses is that no expert org owns the problem, by being approved by clients yet given clear abilities and incentives to solve the problem. Yes this is a big ask, and this is my generic solution to many problems.

{"completion": " We economists tend to see strong levers in the formal mechanisms of social institutions, which we happen to be well-placed to study. And in fact, we have seen big effects of such formal institutions in theory, the lab, and the field. Furthermore, we can imagine actually changing these mechanisms, because they tend to be stable, are sometimes changed, and can be clearly identified and concisely described. Even stronger levers are found in the higher level legal, regulatory, and political institutions that control all the other institutions.My Ph.D. in social science at Caltech focused on such controlling institutions, via making formal game theory models, and testing them in the lab and field. This research finds that institution mechanisms and rules can have big effects on outcomes. Furthermore, we seem to see many big institutional failures in particular areas like telecom, transport, energy, education, housing, and medicine, wherein poor choices of institutions, laws, and regulations in such areas combine to induce large yet understandable waste and inefficiency. Yes institutions do matter, a lot.However, an odd thing happens when we consider higher level models. When we model the effects of general legal and democratic institutions containing rational agents, we usually find that such institutions work out pretty well. Common fears of concentrated interests predating on diffuse interests, or of the poor taxing the rich to death, are not usually borne out. While the real world does seem full of big institutional problems at lower levels, our general models of political processes do not robustly predict these common problems.

And that\u2019s not a distributional coalition. That\u2019s not lobbying. That\u2019s sort of something we\u2019ve imposed upon ourselves. \u2026[EK:] it\u2019s not that I want to go be part of slowing down society and an annoying bureaucrat. Everybody\u2019s a hero of their own story. So how do you think the stories people tell themselves in our country have changed for this to be true? \u2026[AT:] an HOA composed of kind of randos from the community telling you what your windows can look like, it\u2019s not an obvious outcome of a successful society developing coalitions who all want to pursue their own self-interest. \u2026 naked self-interest is less important than some other things.

And in fact, we have seen big effects of such formal institutions in theory, the lab, and the field. Furthermore, we can imagine actually changing these mechanisms, because they tend to be stable, are sometimes changed, and can be clearly identified and concisely described. Even stronger levers are found in the higher level legal, regulatory, and political institutions that control all the other institutions.My Ph.D. in social science at Caltech focused on such controlling institutions, via making formal game theory models, and testing them in the lab and field. This research finds that institution mechanisms and rules can have big effects on outcomes. Furthermore, we seem to see many big institutional failures in particular areas like telecom, transport, energy, education, housing, and medicine, wherein poor choices of institutions, laws, and regulations in such areas combine to induce large yet understandable waste and inefficiency. Yes institutions do matter, a lot.However, an odd thing happens when we consider higher level models. When we model the effects of general legal and democratic institutions containing rational agents, we usually find that such institutions work out pretty well. Common fears of concentrated interests predating on diffuse interests, or of the poor taxing the rich to death, are not usually borne out. While the real world does seem full of big institutional problems at lower levels, our general models of political processes do not robustly predict these common problems. Even when such models include voters who are quite ignorant or error prone. What are such models missing?Bryan Caplan\u2019s book\u00a0Myth of the Rational Voter gets a bit closer to the truth with his concept of \u201crational irrationality\u201d. And I was heartened to see Alex Tabarrok [AT] and Ezra Klein [EK], who have quite different political inclinations, basically agree on the key problem in their recent podcast:[AT:] Mancur Olson thought he saw \u2026 more and more of these distributional coalitions, which are not just redistributing resources to themselves, but also slowing down\u2026 change. \u2026 used to be that we required three people to be on the hiring committee. This year, we have nine \u2026 Now, we need [more] rules. \u2026 we\u2019ve created this more bureaucratic, kind of rule-bound, legalistic and costly structure. And that\u2019s not a distributional coalition. That\u2019s not lobbying. That\u2019s sort of something we\u2019ve imposed upon ourselves. \u2026[EK:] it\u2019s not that I want to go be part of slowing down society and an annoying bureaucrat. Everybody\u2019s a hero of their own story. So how do you think the stories people tell themselves in our country have changed for this to be true? \u2026[AT:] an HOA composed of kind of randos from the community telling you what your windows can look like, it\u2019s not an obvious outcome of a successful society developing coalitions who all want to pursue their own self-interest. \u2026 naked self-interest is less important than some other things. And I\u2019ll give you an example which supports what you\u2019re saying. And that is, if you look at renters and the opinions of renters, and they are almost as NIMBY, Not In My Backyard, as owners, right, which is crazy.\u2026 farmers get massive redistribution in their favor. \u2026 But yet, if you go to the public \u2026 They\u2019re, oh, no, we\u2019ve got to protect the family farm. \u2026[EK:] a lot of political science \u2026 traditionally thought redistribution would be more powerful than it has proven to be \u2026 as societies get richer, they begin emphasizing what he calls post-materialist values, these moral values, these identity values, values about fairness.

Of course many have been trying to do exactly this for centuries. Even so, this approach might still be our best hope.Futarchy \u2013 My proposed solution is also to try to convince political minds to not trust their own judgements, but only regarding on matters of fact, and only relative to the judgements of speculative markets. Speculative market minds are in fact vastly more informed and rational than the usual political minds. And cheap small scale trials are feasible that could lead naturally to larger scale trials that could go a long way toward convincing many political minds of this key fact. It is quite possible to adopt political institutions that put speculative markets in charge of estimating matters of fact. At which point we\u2019d only be subject to political mind failures regarding values. I have other ideas for this, but let\u2019s tackle one problem at a time.Politics is indeed the mind killer.

Quoting Zac Gochenour:The typical human body has a muscle to fat ratio similar to a bear, which is about 770 calories per pound. If the average post-apocalyptic person weighs about 130 lbs and is a bit leaner than a bear (say 600 calories per pound), throw away say 20 lbs of bones and 20 lbs of inedible organs, leaves you with about 54000 calories. Assuming 1200 calories a day for survival, that\u2019s 45 person days per human body. 1200 may be too high; I\u2019ve read concentration camp prisoners survived for months on about 300-500 calories per day, engaged in some degree of hard labor.I figure the biggest problem facing such a population would be lack of essential nutrients. Vitamin C, for instance. The way the eskimos (who traditionally ate a diet consisting almost entirely on meat and fish) dealt with this is by eating their meat raw and keeping the vitamin C in tact. The cannibals would have to do the same.\u201dEven at a rate of 100 person days per body, that would use up 1% of the population per day. \u00a0An initial population of 100 million, killed off at this rate, would have only one person left after five years.  In the novel there were many corpses around that clearly hadn\u2019t been eaten; if only half the bodies were eaten, the population would last half as long.  No way a kid lives to be seven when born into a world where the main food is cannibalism.Given how lauded and celebrated is this book, didn\u2019t anyone else has pointed these out before?

How is this at all evidence against such beliefs serving in large part as group badges?[W]e engage in a wide variety of activities that have a religious or even cult-like feel to them, but which are entirely devoid of supernatural beliefs. \u2026 The fact that these behavioral patterns are so consistent, and thrive even in the absence of supernatural beliefs, strongly suggests that the beliefs are a secondary factor.I struggle to see the logic here. Yes, the world\u2019s leading religions have much in common with secular movements. But how does that suggest that what distinguishes these religions from secular movements is \u201csecondary\u201d? Indeed, doesn\u2019t it suggest precisely the opposite conclusion \u2013 that supernatural beliefs are what makes leading religions special?Common features suggest common structures and functions. We don\u2019t say the differences are unimportant.We think people can generally intuit what\u2019s good for them. \u2026This seems like a rash overstatement. For starters, if the religious order is stable and powerful, doubts are dangerous. [Their] own model suggests that the oppressed would develop pronounced Stockholm Syndrome. Why? To avoid social sanctions. The best way to convince your oppressor that you love him is to love him sincerely.We mean \u201cgood for them\u201d in an individual, not collective, sense. Acting religious can give a personal gain even when it is a social loss.To lock in the benefits of cooperation, then, a community also needs robust mechanisms to keep cheaters at bay.Strangely, though, many of the leading religions loudly proclaim that they welcome everyone. And they live up to this rather naive promise to an amazing degree. I was raised Catholic for my first sixteen years, and can\u2019t recall any anti-cheating mechanism more \u201crobust\u201d than collective scolding.But the key question is: was that scolding enough? Religious groups vary in their strength of bonding, and thus in their severity of punishment. Instead of\u00a0a young Caplan guessing that he could have cheated, it would have been more persuasive to hear an example of someone actually cheating and gaining without giving enough back. Yet even then we have to expect a few successful cheaters.People who believe they risk punishment for disobeying God are more likely to behave well, relative to nonbelievers. \u2026I\u2019ve often heard economists make claims like this. But when you look at the real world, it\u2019s far from clear that disobedience and belief in divine punishment are even negatively correlated. Luther and Calvin, the fathers of modern Protestantism, preached \u2026 our salvation is absolutely beyond your control. Nevertheless, fundamentalist Protestants have long been known for strict adherence to the rules.As I used to be a fundamentalist Protestant myself, it seems clear to me that most practicing fundamentalist Protestants today see a connection between their behavior and divine punishment, no matter what doctrines Luther and Calvin once endorsed.There\u2019s also a peculiar omission in this chapter.

And they\u2019re so eager to show that strange behavior could be functional that they frequently forget to ask, \u201cFunctional when?\u201d and \u201cFunctional for whom?\u201dAlas his specific complaints seem to me more like attempts to misread us to find things to criticize. But you be the judge. Bryan starts (he\u2019s indented once, our book twice):And yet, as we\u2019ll see, there\u2019s a self-serving logic to even the most humble and earnest of religious activities.The last sentence seems like a clear case of overstatement. What about hidden religiosity? Persecuted religiosity?If we had said \u201ckitchen tools have practical household uses\u201d, would Bryan say \u201cBut a burglar could stab you with a kitchen knife\u201d? Is is really hard to find group-conflict functions of religious persecution, or of hiding your religiosity from likely persecutors?We don\u2019t worship simply because we believe. Instead, we worship (and believe) because it helps us as social creatures.While this story is plausible, [they] don\u2019t really grapple with the strongest counter-arguments. Most obviously, arcane doctrinal disputes seem to be the sparks behind several major historical events. Take the Protestant Reformation. Yes, there\u2019s plenty of realpolitik under the surface. But it\u2019s hard to deny that Luther, Calvin, and other key figures did put beliefs in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cThe dog ate my homework\u201d only works as an excuse because sometimes dogs do eat homework. Similarly, we say while we give too much credit to a usual motive, and too little to a more hidden one, the usual motive is part of the mix.

What does however, her research found, is something she has termed \u201csponsorship\u201d\u2014a type of strategic workplace partnering between those with potential and those with power. \u2026Women are only half as likely as men to have a sponsor\u2014a senior champion at work who will basically take a bet on them, tap them on the shoulder, and really give them a shot at leadership.\u00a0Women have always had mentors, friendly figures who give lots of advice. They\u2019re great. They\u2019re good for your self-esteem; they\u2019re good for your personal development. But no one\u2019s ever been able to show that they do anything to help you actually move up. \u2026We find that women in particular often choose the wrong people. \u2026 They seek out a senior person they\u2019re very comfortable with. \u2026 For a sponsor, you should go after the person with power, because you need someone who has a voice at those decision-making tables. You need to respect that person, you need to believe that person is a fabulous leader and going places, but you don\u2019t need to like them. You don\u2019t need to want to emulate them. \u2026Senior leaders are looking for three things [in someone to sponsor]. They told me they\u2019re looking for someone who performs exceedingly well\u2014whether it\u2019s writing amazing legal briefs or really hitting those numbers, that\u2019s at the heart of it. Secondly, you\u2019ve got to demonstrate loyalty, because there\u2019s risk in the relationship. This person is going to take a bet on you. And then thirdly, you have to bring some special value, some currency, to the table that the leader doesn\u2019t have. \u2026The cardinal rule here is to give before you get. \u2026 Figure out how you could be valuable and then sponsorship flows. \u2026 You can\u2019t say, \u201cHow can I be valuable?\u201d\u2014unless in your mind you already know that a piece of work in your back pocket actually could fit into this person\u2019s urgent agenda. \u2026One of the tactics to get to know a senior person in your organization, and in a more peer-on-peer way to impress them, is actually to get involved in some community or professional organization which is a little outside of work. \u2026When a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is delivering on the performance, the loyalty and the value-added front, they propel the career of the senior person. \u2026 One senior leader said to me, \u201cI don\u2019t do empathy.

I make strategic investments in young people, and a whole lot has to be coming back.\u201d (more)Note that while bald statements of cynicism are usually censured in public discourse, this particular statement is accepted since it is framed as\u00a0being in the service of a noble cause: helping women to break the glass ceiling in management.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: November 17, 2013 11:30 am \nTitle: Careers Need Allies\nOrgs coordinate activity.

If a successful challenger can explain well enough how they managed to evade your defenses, then they might get 2N gold coins or more. Coin redeemers may be suspected of being tied to a real assassin, and so they must agree to opening themselves to being investigated in extra depth, and if still deemed suspicious enough they might be banned from ever using a challenge coin again.

Some who issue challenge coins might try to hide transmitters in them, but holders could just wrap coins in aluminum foil and dip them in plastic to limit odor emissions. I estimate that challenge coins are legal, and not prohibited by asset or gambling regulations.This same approach could be used by the TSA to show everyone how hard it is to slip unapproved items past TSA security. Just reveal your coin and your unapproved item right after you exit TSA security. You could also use this approach to convince an audience that your accounting books are clean; anyone with a coin can point to any particular item in your books, and demand an independent investigation of that item, paid for at the coin-issuer\u2019s expense. If the item is found to not be as it should, the coin holder gets the announced prize; otherwise they just lose their coin.In general, issuing challenge coins is a way to show an audience what rate of detection success (or security failure) results from what level of financial incentives. (The audience will need to see data on the rates of coin sales and successful vs. unsuccessful redemptions.)

Most would be more intellectually productive, however, in chasing mode. It helps to have in mind a question, puzzle, or problem, and then read in order to answer your question, explain your puzzle, or solve your problem.In searching mode, readers tend to be less critical. If a source came recommended, they tend to keep reading along even if they aren\u2019t quite sure what the point is.

{"completion": " Before going into details, let\u2019s review a few basics. Like physics, econ uses math to create a space of possible models. But instead of describing physical systems, econ models describe social systems. Economists have a standard set of assumptions that they see as most likely to be true, and other standard set of assumptions that seem easiest to analyze. Assumptions from the second set are often preferred, to allow entire models to be simple enough to analyze. Different economists explore different models, comparing them to each other and to data, and arguing about their relative accuracy as approximations. If you are arguing for different models in this topic area, but accepting that models are a reasonable way to think about social behavior, then you are doing econ. (And you might have a valid complaint re if your kind of econ gets a fair hearing.) Econ critics, in contrast, reject, or at lest minimize the value of, the whole econ approach to studying social behavior, and designing policy.That said, let us now consider some common econ criticisms.Macro Forecasting\u00a0\u2013 Economists can predict many things with high accuracy, but have low accuracy when predicting some big important aggregate changes, like the timing and size of recessions, wars, and asset price falls. Physicists are also unable to predict some large aggregates, such as the weather, and other places where turbulence dominates. In both cases our best theories go a long way to explaining why such things are generally hard to predict. Yet this lack of ability is held against economists, but not against physicists. Even though no other social analysts can predict these macro changes substantially better than do economists. Seems an unfair double standard to me.Objectivity Is A Lie \u2013 Like many other academic disciplines, such as physics and engineering, economists endorse norms of neutrality and objectivity, and adopt many social practices with an eye to encouraging such tendencies. However, some say that such attempts are mistaken; social analysis goes better when analysts announce and embrace their passions and partisan leanings. But would this really make physics or engineering go better? Should legal judges and teachers no longer aspire to treat all plaintiffs and students neutrally? If you accept that neutrality is often a useful ideal, but reject it for economic analysis, then what key difference in economics justifies this different treatment? Yes, there are many specific differences, but I can\u2019t see one that works. We should of course be honest about how much objectivity we actually achieve, which may be disappointingly small. But it still seems an ideal worth working toward.Unfair Privilege \u2013 Compared to other social scientists and analysts, those associated with economists get more respect and attention, in business, government, and the media. As a result, they tend to be paid more, and their concepts are more widely known and used. Others who do social analysis complain that this is unfair. And it would be if this dominance were caused by a cabal of powerful insiders who control social analysis in these areas of life, and favor themselves. But there is in fact a great deal of competition for social analysis in these areas. And there\u2019s no reason different kinds of social analysts should get equal attention, if there\u2019s no reason to think them equally productive.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Engineers who use physics tend to create system designs that are more like typical physics models, with a small number of simple parts having a few simple relations to one another.

Nature faced different constraints, which is why her designs are different. Yes, simple modular designs can be harsh and alienating, but without them we could not create engineering designs nearly as capable. Humans just can\u2019t do analysis without making a mass of simplifying, and thus wrong, assumptions. But the fact that our designs tend to work shows that our approximations tend to be appropriate. Yes of courses if we approximate badly, our models and designs will go badly. Which is why physicists and engineers pay so much attention to approximating well.Now consider the many critiques of economics, which I\u2019ve just spent many hours sampling. Most econ critiques are much like the above physics critique, making a similar response appropriate. But with one key difference, to be discussed at the end.\n\n###\n\n"}
{"completion": " Market Fetish \u2013 Economists\u2019 models of markets are especially simple, and also especially robust as approximations of more complex variations. This leads economists to often recommend markets. Critics call this a bias, part of a larger economists\u2019 bias toward stark, mechanistic, inhuman, inorganic social institutions. But\u00a0if so, it is the same sort of \u201cbias\u201d that makes physical engineers prefer device designs that are easier to analyze with tractable physics models. While there may well be better designs out there in the vast space of designs too complex to analyze, we just don\u2019t know which ones they are. Similarly, without a better way to evaluate the vast space of complex institution alternatives to markets, we must choose among the ones we can evaluate. (Some say to trust their intuitions about the virtues of particular complex candidates they like; economists aren\u2019t very trusting here.)Commodification \u2013 This is actually a complaint about markets, not economists. The idea is that long ago, when people lived in small communities, they each had far more negotiating power re their deals with each other, which made each person feel valued. As communities got larger, and markets got thicker, negotiating power fell, closer substitutes appeared for whatever any one person had to offer. Some say that we feel less valued as a result, more like \u201ccommodities\u201d, and they suggest banning some kinds of markets, forcing people into less formal more fragmented deal-making, where they have more negotiating power. Standard economic theory, however, suggests we are worse off with such fragmented deal-making, and the fact that people tend to choose large over small communities, when they have a choice, suggests that most people agree. When both sides get more negotiating power, that just increases variance in deal value to each side, not the average.Reductionism \u2013 Like physicists, economists build models of big worlds made out of many small parts, in their case the many particular choices of particular people. Some object that social analysis works better when it considers large aggregates, like classes, ideologies, nations, regions, and professions, as the most basic units of analysis. But economists don\u2019t object to thinking in terms of such units. It is just that, like physicists, we are much more comfortable when when know how to describe such larger in terms of many small parts. Physics concepts like pressure, temperature, entropy, and much more are useful aggregate concepts, but helpfully understood in terms of interactions between small parts.Rationality \u2013 A common econ assumption is that people act in ways that get them what they want. This turns out to be robust to noise; assuming that we only tend to act to get what we want usually gives pretty similar results. And many economists explore models where various other factors influence action choices. Even so, critics say that this usual assumption undermines economist authority, and implies that others should not listen to them. But this seems to reject the very idea of using simplifying models.Selfishness \u2013 Another common econ assumption is that people want more personal material gains for themselves. (Sometimes they even assume people want only money.) This assumption is usually robust to people merely putting more weight on themselves than on others, and to their caring a great deal about a small number of close associates. And many economists explore other alternate assumptions. Even so, critics suggest that this usual assumption undermines economist authority. Again, this seems to reject the very idea of simplifying models.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Before going into details, let\u2019s review a few basics. Like physics, econ uses math to create a space of possible models. But instead of describing physical systems, econ models describe social systems. Economists have a standard set of assumptions that they see as most likely to be true, and other standard set of assumptions that seem easiest to analyze. Assumptions from the second set are often preferred, to allow entire models to be simple enough to analyze. Different economists explore different models, comparing them to each other and to data, and arguing about their relative accuracy as approximations. If you are arguing for different models in this topic area, but accepting that models are a reasonable way to think about social behavior, then you are doing econ. (And you might have a valid complaint re if your kind of econ gets a fair hearing.) Econ critics, in contrast, reject, or at lest minimize the value of, the whole econ approach to studying social behavior, and designing policy.That said, let us now consider some common econ criticisms.Macro Forecasting\u00a0\u2013 Economists can predict many things with high accuracy, but have low accuracy when predicting some big important aggregate changes, like the timing and size of recessions, wars, and asset price falls. Physicists are also unable to predict some large aggregates, such as the weather, and other places where turbulence dominates. In both cases our best theories go a long way to explaining why such things are generally hard to predict. Yet this lack of ability is held against economists, but not against physicists. Even though no other social analysts can predict these macro changes substantially better than do economists. Seems an unfair double standard to me.Objectivity Is A Lie \u2013 Like many other academic disciplines, such as physics and engineering, economists endorse norms of neutrality and objectivity, and adopt many social practices with an eye to encouraging such tendencies. However, some say that such attempts are mistaken; social analysis goes better when analysts announce and embrace their passions and partisan leanings. But would this really make physics or engineering go better? Should legal judges and teachers no longer aspire to treat all plaintiffs and students neutrally? If you accept that neutrality is often a useful ideal, but reject it for economic analysis, then what key difference in economics justifies this different treatment? Yes, there are many specific differences, but I can\u2019t see one that works. We should of course be honest about how much objectivity we actually achieve, which may be disappointingly small. But it still seems an ideal worth working toward.Unfair Privilege \u2013 Compared to other social scientists and analysts, those associated with economists get more respect and attention, in business, government, and the media. As a result, they tend to be paid more, and their concepts are more widely known and used. Others who do social analysis complain that this is unfair. And it would be if this dominance were caused by a cabal of powerful insiders who control social analysis in these areas of life, and favor themselves. But there is in fact a great deal of competition for social analysis in these areas. And there\u2019s no reason different kinds of social analysts should get equal attention, if there\u2019s no reason to think them equally productive.\n\n###\n\n"}
{"completion": " Stable Preferences \u2013 Econ models of what people want usually contain a limited number of contributing factors, and limited ways in which wants change with context. Critics, however, are often impressed with how what people want seems to change over their lifetimes, and has differed across in societies in history. Critics often conclude that there\u2019s little point in analyzing how to get people what they want, as society can change what people want. However, any dependence of what people want on social choices is just another form of context dependence of wants, and fits directly into standard model frameworks. It is fine for economists to make such models and to argue for them. But that\u2019s a way of doing economics, not of rejecting it.Other Assumptions \u2013 Critics tend to complain about econ model assumption unrealism, but usually fail to mention many examples. Let\u2019s help them out. Econ models focus on \u201csmall worlds,\u201d leaving out larger outside connected world. Econ models tend to model only limited kinds of uncertainty, yet we actually can be uncertain about almost everything. Different games are analyzed separately, but in fact uncertainty about what game we play merges them into one big game. Models also usually ignore uncertainty about which computational strategies, and decision and game theories, apply. Models use finite and infinite state spaces when the other is more plausible. And econ models often make unrealistic assumptions about actor variety, action timing, action durations, action knowledge, commitments, externalities, insurance, public announcements, and motivations. We usually assume we are near an interior local maximum with concave payoffs.Wealth Maximization \u2013 This seems the most common complaint, so I\u2019ll discuss it in more detail. Economists\u2019 gold standard for evaluating social policy is \u201cPareto improvement\u201d [PI]; a policy change is good if everyone expects to get more of what they want, or at least would so expect if they fully aggregated their info. A common approximation to PI uses what people expect to gain, without info their aggregating. When transfers cancel losses that observers can estimate, a good approximation to PI is repeated application of cost-benefit analysis, which in essence seeks to max economic (not just financial) \u201cwealth.\u201d Being a net loser here requires implausibly large correlations across many errors in observer loss estimates.Some call it immoral to give people what they want; policy should instead do what is moral, about which econ knows little. But others (e.g. preference utilitarians) see big moral gains from people getting what they want. And econ using a wealth metric can suggest deals for negotiators to consider, which seems a useful social role for economists to fill; policy advice need not be about morality. Also, just as firms typically use artsy design to set a few surface features, but then use engineering to minimize costs along thousands of orthogonal design dimensions, it can make sense to set overall policy via a few key salient moral and aesthetic criteria, such as various kinds of inequality, and yet set thousands of less visible orthogonal policy parameters via wealth maximization. If a parameter doesn\u2019t much influence key overall dimensions, why not set it to minimize costs?The above are the most common econ critiques I see.

{"completion": " Little Outcome Competition \u2013 Physics-based engineers often compete to make devices that are shown to work or not relatively quickly. But the advice from economist-affiliated policy advisors is not tested as strongly, often, or directly as that of physics-based engineers. So while we might say that econ has won a competition of some sort, it is less clear that this is a competition to be useful in policy design. Perhaps economists are more often just telling customers what they want to hear, or letting them affiliate with economists\u2019 impressive analysis abilities. It is worth noting that the econ advice embodied in the most prestigious econ publications often differs substantially from the advice that the same economists give in non-economist forums. Of course if other social analysts seem similarly disconnected from real world tests, this isn\u2019t a reason to favor them over economists. Nor to favor your own intuitions, which also haven\u2019t been much tested.As an econ insider, I can see better than most outsiders how well econ models and analysis fits data on human behavior. And having once been deeply immersed in physics and engineering, I can see roughly how econ practices compare to those. I see great insight in common econ model assumptions and practices of approximation, and a substantial continuity with similar practices in physics and engineering (who also have great insight). Economists actually know a lot about the social world, and have tools that can usefully inform social policy. But I can also see how the key institutions that organize economists too often fail to induce us to tell what we know to outsiders. I know, as an outsider you might well expect me to say that about my field even if it were not true.

For congestion goods, the more that one person consumes of the good, the harder it gets for others to consume it.  For scale goods, in contrast, the more that some consume, the easier it gets for others to consume.Creating a new person with a demand for some good, or raising an existing person\u2019s demand for that good, has very different effects on others, depending on whether it is a congestion or scale good.  Adding new demand for congestion goods hurts others, while adding new demand for scale goods helps others.For example, an increase in your demand for limited beachfront property, or for food prepared personally by today\u2019s most famous chef, hurts others who also demand those goods.  Your increased demand for certain computer chips could also hurt others, if such chips required a special metal in limited supply.Chips, however, are usually net scale goods: bigger chip plants make chips cheaper, and larger demand justifies higher fixed costs such as in chip design, and induces faster innovation in chip design, manufacture, use, etc.  Larger communities of users for a good can also benefit from network externalities, such as when a phone or IM system becomes more valuable because more other folks can be contacted via them.

{"completion": " The collapse of order brings .. famine, war, pestilence, and death. .. Population declines and wages increase, while rents decline. .. Fortunes of the upper classes hit bottom. .. Civil wars thin the ranks of the elites. .. Intra-elite competition subsides, allowing the restoration of order. Stability and internal peace bring prosperity, and another cycle begins. (pp.5-8 W&P&W)Turchin (& coauthor Nefedov) collect much data to show that this is a robust farmer-era pattern, even if there are many\u00a0deviations. For example, in Europe, 33 of 43 frontier situations\u00a0gave rise to big empires, yet only 4 of 57 of non-frontier\u00a0situations\u00a0did (p.84 HD). \u201cSecular cycles\u201d vary in duration from one to four centuries; Western Europe saw 8 cycles in 22 centuries, while China saw 8 cycles in 21 centuries (p.306,311 SC). During the low instability part of each cycle, instability shows a rough \u201calternating generations\u201d 50 year cycle of conflict.I\u2019ll grant that Turchin seems to have documented a reasonably broad pattern, containing most of his claimed elements. Yes, empires tend to start from frontier groups with high cohesion, and core cohesion changes slowly. First there\u2019s war success and a growing area and population, and bigger cities. Eventually can come crowding and falling wages. Inequality also grows, with more richer elites, and this is quite robust, continuing even after wages fall.While the amount of external war doesn\u2019t change over the cycle, success in war falls. Many signs of social cohesion decline, and eventually there\u2019s more elite infighting, with crime, duels, misspending state revenue, mistreatment of subordinates, and eventually civil war. Big wars can cut population, and also elite numbers and wealth. Eventually war abates and cohesion rises, though not to as high as when the empire started. A new cycle may begin; empires go through 1-3 cycles before being displaced by another empire.Just as science fiction is often (usually?) an allegory about issues today, I suspect\u00a0that historians who blame a particular fault for the fall of the Roman Empire tend to pick faults that they also want to warn against in their own era. Similarly, my main complain about Turchin is that he attributes falling cohesion mainly to increased inequality \u2013 an \u201coverproduction\u201d of elites who face \u201cincreased competition\u201d. Yes, inequality is much talked about among elites today, but the (less-forager-like) ancients were less focused on it.As Scheidel said in The Great Leveler, inequality doesn\u2019t seem to cause civil wars, and civil wars tend to increase inequality during and after the war (p.203). External wars reduce inequality for losers and increase it for winners, without changing it much overall. It is only big mass mobilization wars of the 1900s that seem to clearly cause big falls in inequality.In biology, over multiple generations organisms slowly accumulate genetic mutations, which reduce their fitness. But this degradation is countered by the fact that nature and mates select for better organisms, which have fewer mutations. Similarly, it seems to me that the most straightforward account of the secular cycle is to say since empire founders are selected out of a strong competition for very high cohesion, we should expect cohesion to \u201cregress to the mean\u201d as an empire evolves.That is, in order to predict most of the observed elite misdeeds later in the secular cycle, all we need to assume is a\u00a0random walk in cohesion that tends to fall back to typical levels. Yes, we might want to include other effects in our model. For example, civil war may allow a bit more selection for subgroups with more cohesion, and humans may have a psychological inclination to cohere more during and after a big war. But mostly we should just expect cohesion to decline from its initial extreme value, and that\u2019s all\u00a0a simple\u00a0model needs.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: February 16, 2017 3:30 pm \nTitle: Cycles of War & Empire\nI\u2019ve just read five of Peter Turchin\u2019s books: Historical Dynamics (2003), War & Peace & War (2006), Secular Cycles (2009), Ultra Society (2015), and Ages of Discord (2016).

{"completion": " Yes, Turchin claims that we know more about what causes cohesion declines. But while he\u00a0goes to great effort to show that the data fit his story on which events happen\u00a0in what order during cycles, I didn\u2019t see him\u00a0offering evidence to support\u00a0his claim that inequality causes less\u00a0cohesion. He just repeatedly gives examples where\u00a0inequality\u00a0happened, and then instability happened, as if that proves that the one caused the other.We already have good reasons to expect new empires to start with a small area, population, and inequality. And this by itself is enough to predict growing population, which eventually crowds to cut wages, and increasing inequality, which should happen consistently in a very wide range of situations. I don\u2019t see a need for, or data support for, the additional hypothesis that inequality cuts\u00a0cohesion. We may of course discover more things that influence cohesion, and if so we can add them to\u00a0our basic secular cycle model. But we don\u2019t need\u00a0such\u00a0additions\u00a0to predict most\u00a0of the cycle features that Turchin describes.In his latest book, Turchin points out many U.S. signs today of rising inequality and\u00a0declining social cohesion, and at the end asks \u201cWill we be capable of taking collective action to avoid the worst of the impending democratic -structural crisis? I hope so.\u201d But I worry that his focus on inequality leads people to think they need to\u00a0fight harder to cut inequality. In contrast, what we mostly need is just to fight less. The main way that inequality threatens to destroy us is that we are tempted to fight over it. Instead, let us try more to see ourselves as an \u201cus\u201d contrasted with a \u201cthem\u201d, an us that needs to stick together, in part via chilling and compromising, especially regarding\u00a0divisive topics like inequality.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "The collapse of order brings .. famine, war, pestilence, and death. .. Population declines and wages increase, while rents decline. .. Fortunes of the upper classes hit bottom. .. Civil wars thin the ranks of the elites. .. Intra-elite competition subsides, allowing the restoration of order. Stability and internal peace bring prosperity, and another cycle begins. (pp.5-8 W&P&W)Turchin (& coauthor Nefedov) collect much data to show that this is a robust farmer-era pattern, even if there are many\u00a0deviations. For example, in Europe, 33 of 43 frontier situations\u00a0gave rise to big empires, yet only 4 of 57 of non-frontier\u00a0situations\u00a0did (p.84 HD). \u201cSecular cycles\u201d vary in duration from one to four centuries; Western Europe saw 8 cycles in 22 centuries, while China saw 8 cycles in 21 centuries (p.306,311 SC). During the low instability part of each cycle, instability shows a rough \u201calternating generations\u201d 50 year cycle of conflict.I\u2019ll grant that Turchin seems to have documented a reasonably broad pattern, containing most of his claimed elements. Yes, empires tend to start from frontier groups with high cohesion, and core cohesion changes slowly. First there\u2019s war success and a growing area and population, and bigger cities. Eventually can come crowding and falling wages. Inequality also grows, with more richer elites, and this is quite robust, continuing even after wages fall.While the amount of external war doesn\u2019t change over the cycle, success in war falls. Many signs of social cohesion decline, and eventually there\u2019s more elite infighting, with crime, duels, misspending state revenue, mistreatment of subordinates, and eventually civil war. Big wars can cut population, and also elite numbers and wealth. Eventually war abates and cohesion rises, though not to as high as when the empire started. A new cycle may begin; empires go through 1-3 cycles before being displaced by another empire.Just as science fiction is often (usually?) an allegory about issues today, I suspect\u00a0that historians who blame a particular fault for the fall of the Roman Empire tend to pick faults that they also want to warn against in their own era. Similarly, my main complain about Turchin is that he attributes falling cohesion mainly to increased inequality \u2013 an \u201coverproduction\u201d of elites who face \u201cincreased competition\u201d. Yes, inequality is much talked about among elites today, but the (less-forager-like) ancients were less focused on it.As Scheidel said in The Great Leveler, inequality doesn\u2019t seem to cause civil wars, and civil wars tend to increase inequality during and after the war (p.203). External wars reduce inequality for losers and increase it for winners, without changing it much overall. It is only big mass mobilization wars of the 1900s that seem to clearly cause big falls in inequality.In biology, over multiple generations organisms slowly accumulate genetic mutations, which reduce their fitness. But this degradation is countered by the fact that nature and mates select for better organisms, which have fewer mutations. Similarly, it seems to me that the most straightforward account of the secular cycle is to say since empire founders are selected out of a strong competition for very high cohesion, we should expect cohesion to \u201cregress to the mean\u201d as an empire evolves.That is, in order to predict most of the observed elite misdeeds later in the secular cycle, all we need to assume is a\u00a0random walk in cohesion that tends to fall back to typical levels. Yes, we might want to include other effects in our model. For example, civil war may allow a bit more selection for subgroups with more cohesion, and humans may have a psychological inclination to cohere more during and after a big war. But mostly we should just expect cohesion to decline from its initial extreme value, and that\u2019s all\u00a0a simple\u00a0model needs.\n\n###\n\n"}

Dalio repeatedly encourages honesty, but he admits that it is often painful, and that many aren\u2019t suited for it. He mainly just says to push through the pain, and get rid of people who resist it, and says that these big visible up-front costs will all be worth it in the long run.Dalio also seems to equate conflict and negative opinions with honesty. That is, he seeks a culture where people can say things that others would rather not hear, but doesn\u2019t seem to consider that such negative opinions need not be \u201chonest\u201d opinions. The book makes hundreds of claims, but doesn\u2019t cite outside sources, nor compare itself to other writings on the subject.

{"completion": " Yes, there are many ways one might argue that this economist\u2019 practice is ethically good. But I make no such arguments here.Yes, there are other possible ways to help people. Helping them identify deals is not the only way, and often not the best way, to help or advise people.Most people want in part to be moral, and they think that what they and others want is relevant to what acts are moral. It is just that these two concepts are not identical.\u00a0If in fact what people want is only and wholly to be ethical, then the difference between being ethical and getting what you want collapses. But even so, this econ approach remains useful, and in this case our advice now also becomes ethical.The same arguments apply if we replace \u201cbe ethical\u201d with \u201cdo what you have good reasons to do\u201d. If there is a difference, then others should seek our advice more if it is on what they want, relative to what they have reasons to do.What if the process of hearing our advice, or following it, can change what people want? (The advice might include a sermon, and doing something can change how you feel about it.) In this case, people will most seek out our advice when those changes in wants match their meta-wants regarding such changes. And those meta-wants are revealed in part via how they choose advisors.For example, when people choose advisors retrospectively, based on who seems to have been pleased with the advice that they were given, that reveals a preference for changes in wants that make them pleased after the fact. In that case, you\u2019d want to give the advice that resulted in a combination of outcomes and want changes that made them pleased later. In this case they wouldn\u2019t mind changes to their wants, as long as those resulted in their being more pleased.In contrast, when people choose advisors prospectively, based on how pleased they are now with the outcomes that they expect to result from your advice, then you would only want to offer advice which clients expect to change their wants if such clients expect to be pleased by such changes. So you\u2019d want to offer advice that seemed to promote the want changes that they aspire to, but prevent the want changes that they fear or despise.And that\u2019s it.

Once we know the value of A, exactly one of these two assets can be exchanged for $1; the other is worthless. The chance a of the CEO staying is revealed by trades exchanging one unit of \u201c$1 if A\u201d for a units of $1.The other way to split is $1 = \u201c$x\u201d + \u201c$(1-x)\u201d, where x a real number in [0,1], representing the stock price of that firm at quarter end, except rescaled and clipped so that x is always in [0,1]. Once we know the value of x, then one unit of \u201c$x\u201d can be exchanged for x units of $1, while one unit of \u201c$(1-x)\u201d can be exchanged for 1-x units of $1. The expected value x of the stock is revealed by trades exchanging one unit of \u201c$x\u201d for x units of $1.We can combine this pair of two-way splits into a single four-way split:$1 = \u201c$x if A\u201d + \u201c$x if not A\u201d + \u201c$(1-x) if A\u201d + \u201c$(1-x) if not A\u201d.A simple combinatorial trading implementation would keep track of the quantities each user has of these four assets, and allow them to trade some of these assets for others, as long as none of these quantities became negative. The min of these four quantities is the cash amount that a user can walk away with at any time. And at quarter\u2019s end, the rest turn into some amount of cash, which the user can then walk away with.To advise the firm board on whether to fire the CEO, we are interested in the value that the CEO adds to the firm value.

{"completion": " In principle users could trade any bundle of these four assets for any other bundle. But three kinds of trades have the special feature of supporting maximal use of user assets in the following sense: when users make trades of only that type, two of their four asset quantities will reach zero at the same time. Reaching zero sets the limit of how far a user can trade in that direction.To see this, let us define:d1 = change in quantity of \u201c$x if A\u201d,d2 = change in quantity of \u201c$x if not A\u201d,d3 = change in quantity of \u201c$(1-x) if A\u201d,d4 = change in quantity of \u201c$(1-x) if not A\u201d.Two of these special kinds of trades correspond to the simple A and x trades that we described above. One kind exchanges 1 unit of \u201c$1 if A\u201d for a units of $1, so that d1=d3, d2=d4, -d1*(1-a)=a*d2. The other kind exchanges 1 unit of \u201c$x\u201d for x units of $1, so that d1=d2, d3=d4, -d1*(1-x)=x*d3.The third special trade bundles the diagonals of our 2\u00d72 array of assets, so that d1=d4, d2=d3, -q*d1=(1-q)*d2. But what does q mean? That\u2019s the math I worked out: q = (1-a) + (2a-1)*x + 2a(1-a)*r*x, where r = (x1-x2)/x, and x = a*x1 + (1-a)*x2. So when we have market prices a,x from the other two special markets, we can describe trade ratios q in this diagonal market in terms of the more intuitive parameter r, i.e., the percent value the CEO adds to this firm.When you subsidize markets with many possible dimensions of trade, you don\u2019t have to subsidize all the dimensions equally. So in this case you could subsidize the q=r type trades much more than you do the a or x type trades. This would let you take a limited subsidy budget and direct it as much as possible toward the main dimension of interest: this CEO\u2019s added value.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: May 17, 2022 9:00 am \nTitle: Decision Market Math\nLet me share a bit of math I recently figured out regarding decision markets.

{"completion": " In their attempt to answer normative questions that the science of economics could not address, economists opened the door to economic ideologues who lacked any commitment to scientific integrity. Among these pretend economists, the ones who prized supposed freedom (especially freedom from regulation) over all other concerns proved most useful \u2026\u00a0 When the stakes were high, firms sought out these ideologues to act as their representatives and further their agenda. And just like their more reputable peers, these pretend economists used the unfamiliar language of economics to obscure the moral judgments that undergirded their advice. \u2026Throughout his entire career, Greenspan worked to give financial institutions more leeway \u2026 If economists continue to let people like him define their discipline, the public will send them back to the basement, and for good reason. \u2026The alternative is to make honesty and humility prerequisites for membership in the community of economists. The easy part is to challenge the pretenders. The hard part is to say no when government officials look to economists for an answer to a normative question. Scientific authority never conveys moral authority. No economist has a privileged insight into questions of right and wrong, and none deserves a special say in fundamental decisions about how society should operate. Economists who argue otherwise and exert undue influence in public debates about right and wrong should be exposed for what they are: frauds. (more)Oddly, Romer is famous for advocating \u201ccharter city\u201d experiments, which can be seen as a big way to escape from the usual regulations.So how does Romer suggest we identify \u201cpretend\u201d economists who are to be \u201cexposed as frauds\u201d and \u201cpublicly expelled from economists\u2019 ranks\u201d? He seems to say they are problematic on big but not small issues because firms bribe them, but he admits some are well-meaning, and doesn\u2019t accuse Greenspan of taking bribes. So I doubt he\u2019d settle for expelling only those who are clearly bribed.\u00a0That seems to leave only the fact that they argue for less regulation when common moral intuitions call for more. (Especially when they mention \u201cfreedom\u201d.) Perhaps he wants economists to be expelled when they argue for deregulation, or perhaps when they offer economic analysis contrary to moral intuitions. Both sound terrible to me as intellectual standards.Look, people quite often express \u201cmoral\u201d opinions that are combinations of simple moral intuitions together with intuitions about how social systems work. If they are mistaken about that second part, and if we can gain separate estimates on their moral intuitions, then economic analysis has the potential to produce superior combinations.This is exactly what economists try to do when applying value of life estimates, and this can also be done regarding deregulation. The key point is that when people act on their moral intuitions, then we can use their actions to estimate their morals, and thus include their moral weights in our analysis.In particular, I don\u2019t find it obviously wrong to let for-profit firms market drugs to doctors, nor do I think it remotely obvious that this is the main cause of a consistent four-decade rise in drug deaths.Yes of course, it is a problem if professionals can be bribed to give particular recommendations. But in most of these disputes parties on many sides are willing to offer such distorting rewards. My long-standing recommendation is to use conditional betting markets to induce more honest advice from such professionals, but so far few support that.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: February 13, 2020 11:45 am \nTitle: Defrock Deregulation Economists?\nRecent economics Nobel prize winner Paul Romer is furious that economists have sometimes argued for deregulation; he wants them \u201cdefrocked\u201d, & cast from the profession:\u00a0New generation of economists argued that tweaks \u2026 would enable the market to regulate itself, obviating the need for stringent government oversight. \u2026 To regain the public\u2019s trust, economists should \u2026 emphasize the limits of their knowledge \u2026 even if it requires them to publicly expel from their ranks any member of the community who habitually overreaches. \u2026Consider the rapid spread of cost-benefit analysis \u2026 Lacking clear guidance from voters, legislators, regulators, and judges turned to economists, who resolved the uncertainty by [estimating] \u2026 the amount that society should spend to save a life. \u2026 [This] seems to have worked out surprisingly well \u2026 The trouble arose when the stakes were higher \u2026 it is all too easy for a firm \u2026 to arrange for a pliant pretend economist to \u2026 [defend them] with a veneer of objectivity and scientific expertise. \u2026Imagine making the following proposal in the 1950s: Give for-profit firms the freedom to develop highly addictive painkillers and to promote them via \u2026 marketing campaigns targeted at doctors.

Contagion. People adopt when they come in contact with others who have already adopted; that is, innovations spread much like epidemics.2. Social influence. People adopt when enough other people in the group have adopted; that is, innovations spread by a conformity motive.3. Social learning. People adopt once they see enough empirical evidence to convince them that the innovation is worth adopting, where the evidence is generated by the outcomes among prior adopters. Individuals may adopt at different times due to differences in their prior beliefs, amount of information gathered, and idiosyncratic costs.Social learning is consistent with the observed pattern of diffusion of hybrid corn, although we cannot say that it was the sole explanatory factor. We can also say with some confidence, however, that inertia and contagion were probably not the sole explanatory factors, and given Griliches\u2019s findings neither was social influence.I\u2019ve been watching this innovation process up close for several years, as prediction markets slowly spread through the corporate world.\u00a0 One might hope that we had central technology experts, and once they approved a new tech, everyone would adopt it.\u00a0 No way.\u00a0 People don\u2019t believe something works until they\u2019ve seen it work in something pretty close to their situation.\u00a0 A media story about something far away just doesn\u2019t say much.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: January 15, 2010 6:00 am \nTitle: Diffusion By Learning\n\n###\n\n"}

After all, the auction would have selected for the one person expected to be most worth listening to, at least on average.So now, to induce an informative discussion on a topic, one both subsidizes prediction markets on that topic, and commits to pay each person who wins an auction to speak from a center stage a reward proportional to the info added to those prediction markets while they speak.What if different time periods are expected to add different amounts of info to the market prices through channels other than the center stage speaker? This could bias the debate structure, but isn\u2019t a problem for the auction structure.
