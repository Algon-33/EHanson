{"completion": " I\u2019ve long been intrigued by the idea of private law, wherein people can stay in the same place but\u00a0contract with different legal systems, which then set the rules regarding their legal interactions with others. Such rules might in effect change the laws of tort, crime, marriage, etc. that people\u00a0live under. And so such competition between private laws might push the law to\u00a0evolve toward more efficient laws.One of the things that legal systems tend to do is to protect people from mistakes. For example, contract law won\u2019t enforce contracts it sees as mistakes, and it fills in contract holes it sees resulting from laziness. Law is often DWIM law. Which can be great when you trust your\u00a0law to choose well. But if one is to have an effective choice of private law, and real competition for that role, then one\u2019s current law shouldn\u2019t be able to overrule one\u2019s choice of a new law. Instead, one\u2019s choice of a private legal\u00a0system, like one\u2019s choice of nation, needs to\u00a0be a simple clear choice where one is not much protected from mistakes.Today we don\u2019t in fact have such private law, because our standard legal system won\u2019t enforce contracts we sign that declare our intent to use different legal systems. To achieve private law, we\u2019d need to change this key feature of our standard legal system.Your choice to change nations, either for temporary travel or for permanent moves, can be a big mistake. It might result from temporary mood fluctuations, or from misunderstandings about the old nation or the new. Nevertheless we have little regulation of such choices. Instead individuals are mostly fully exposes to their possible mistakes. For example, while Europe is heavily regulated in general, European teens today can decide to go join ISIS, even when many others greatly regret such choices. We\u00a0disapprove of nations that prevent people from leaving because that cuts\u00a0competition between nations to serve people.Similarly, if we want completion between legal systems without forcing people to move, we\u2019ll have to change our law to accept our not protecting people from bad choices of legal systems. There will have to be a simple clear act by which one chooses a law, a choice not much subject to legal review and reversal. We\u2019d want to encourage people to take such choices seriously, but then to accept the choices they make. Freedom of choice requires a\u00a0freedom to make mistakes.

You must always pay to get an agent who consumes real resources. But agents can earn extra \u201cagency rents\u201d when you and other possible agents can\u2019t see everything that they know and do. And even if an agent doesn\u2019t earn more rents, a more difficult agency relation can cause \u201cagency failure\u201d, wherein you get less of what you want from your agent.Now like any agent, an AI who costs real resources must be paid. And depending on the market and property setup this could let AIs save, accumulate capital, and eventually collectively control most capital. This is an well-known AI concern, that AIs who are more useful than humans might earn more income, and thus become richer and more influential than humans. But this isn\u2019t Christiano\u2019s fear.It is easy to believe that agent rents and failures generally scale roughly with the overall important and magnitude of activities. That is, when we do twice as much, and get roughly twice as much value out of it, we also lose about twice as much potential via agency failures, relative to a perfect agency relation, and the agents gain about twice as much in agency rents. So it is plausible to think that this also happens with AIs as they become more capable; we get more but then so do they, and more potential is lost.Christiano instead fears that as AIs get more capable, the AIs will gain so much more agency rents, and we will suffer so much more due to agency failures, that we will actually become worse off as as result. And not just a bit worse off; we apparently get apocalypse level worse off! This sort of agency apocalypse is not only a far larger problem than we\u2019d expect via simple scaling, it is also not supported anywhere I know of in the large academic literature on agency problems.This literature has found many factors that influence the difficulty of agency relations. Agency tends to be harder when more relevant agent info and actions are hidden both to principals and other agents, when info about outcomes get noisier, when there is more noise in the mapping between effort and outcomes, when agents and principals are more impatient and risk averse, when agents are more unique, when principals can threaten more extreme outcomes, and when agents can more easily coordinate.But this literature has not found that smarter agents are more problematic, all else equal. In fact, the economics literature that models agency problems typically assumes perfectly rational and thus infinitely smart agents, who reason exactly correctly in every possible situation. This typically results in limited and modest agency rents and failures.For concreteness, imagine a twelve year old rich kid, perhaps a king or queen, seeking agents to help manage their wealth or kingdom. It is far from obvious that this child is on average worse off when they choose a smarter more capable agent, or when the overall pool of agents from which they can choose becomes smarter and more capable. And its even less obvious that the kid becomes maximally worse off as their agents get maximally smart and capable. In fact, I suspect the opposite.Of course it remains possible that there is something special about the human-AI agency relation that can justify Christiano\u2019s claims. But surely the burden of \u201cproof\u201d (really argument) should lie on those say this case is radically different from most found in our large and robust agency literatures. (Google Scholar lists 234K papers with keyword \u201cprincipal-agent\u201d.)And even if AI agency problems turn out to be unusual severe, that still doesn\u2019t justify trying to solve them so far in advance of knowing about their details.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: April 10, 2019 3:55 pm \nTitle: Agency Failure AI Apocalypse?\nYears ago my ex-co-blogger Eliezer Yudkowsky and I argued here on this blog about his AI risk fear than an AI so small dumb & weak that few had ever heard of it, might without warning, suddenly \u201cfoom\u201d, i.e., innovate very fast, and take over the world after one weekend. I mostly argued that we have a huge literature on economic growth at odds with this. Historically, the vast majority of innovation has been small, incremental, and spread across many industries and locations. Yes, humans mostly displaced other pre-human species, as such species can\u2019t share innovations well. But since then sharing and complementing of innovations has allowed most of the world to gain from even the biggest lumpiest innovations ever seen. Eliezer said a deep conceptual analysis allowed him to see that this time is different.Since then there\u2019s been a vast increase in folks concerned about AI risk, many focused on scenarios like Yudkowsky\u2019s. (But almost no interest in my critique.) In recent years I\u2019ve heard many say they are now less worried about foom, but have new worries just as serious. Though I\u2019ve found it hard to understand what worries could justify big efforts now, compared to later when we should know far more about powerful AI details. (E.g., worrying about cars, TV, or nukes in the year 1000 would have been way too early.)Enter Paul Christiano (see also Vox summary). Paul says:The stereotyped image of AI catastrophe is a powerful, malicious AI system that takes its creators by surprise and quickly achieves a decisive advantage over the rest of humanity. I think this is probably not what failure will look like, and I want to try to paint a more realistic picture. \u2026\n\n###\n\n"}

{"completion": " Which brings us to the topic of recent progress in machine learning. Google just announced its PaLM system, which fit 540 billion parameters to a \u201chigh-quality corpus of 780 billion tokens that represent a wide range of natural language use cases\u201d, in order to predict from past words the next words appropriate for a wide range of small language tasks. Its performance is impressive; it does well compared to humans on a wide range of such tasks. And yet it still basically \u201cbabbles\u201c; it seems not remotely up to the task of thinking together with a human. If you talked with it for a long time, you might well find ways that it could help you. But still, it wouldn\u2019t think with you.Maybe this problem will be solved by just adding more parameters and data. But I doubt it. I expect that a bigger problem is that such systems have been training at these small language tasks, instead of at the more fundamental task of thinking together. Yes, most of the language data on which they are built is from conversations where humans were thinking together. So they can learn well to say the next small thing in such a conversation. But they seem to be failing to infer the deeper structures that support shared thinking among humans.It might help to assign such a system the task of \u201cuseful inner monologue\u201d. That is, it would start talking to itself, and keep talking indefinitely, continually updating its representations from the data of its internal monologue. The trick would be to generate these monologues and do this update so that the resulting system got better at doing other useful tasks. (I don\u2019t know how to arrange this.) While versions of this approach have been tried before, the fact that this isn\u2019t the usual approach suggests that it doesn\u2019t now produce gains as fast, at least for doing these small language tasks. Even so, if those are misleading metrics, this approach might help more to get real progress at artificial thinking.I will sit up and take notice when the main improvements to systems with\u00a0impressive broad language abilities come from such inner monologues, or from thinking together on other useful tasks. That will look more like systems that have learned how to think. And when such abilities work across a wide scope of topics, that will look to me more like the proverbial \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d.

On average jobs have moved by about a third of a standard deviation, relative to the distribution of job automation across jobs. This is actually quite a lot.

{"completion": " Now think about the space of job tasks as a similar sort of landscape. Two tasks are adjacent to other tasks when the same person tends to do both, when info or objects are passed from one to the other, when they take place close in place and time, and when their details gain from being coordinated. The ease of automating each task depends on how regular and standardized are its inputs, how easy it is to formalize the info on which key choices depend, how easy it is to evaluate and judge outputs, and how simple, stable, and mild are the physical environments in which this task is done.When the tasks near a particular task get more automated, those tasks tend more to happen in a more controlled stable environment, the relevant info tends to be more formalized, and related info and objects get simpler, more standardized, and more reliably available. And this all tends to make it easier to automate such tasks. Much like how land is easier to colonize when nearby land is more colonized.Among the job features that predict automation in our analysis, the strongest is: Pace Determined By Speed Of Equipment. This feature clearly fits my story here; it says you coordinate your task closely with a task done by a machine. Many others fit as well; here is more from our paper:Pace Determined By Speed Of Equipment picks out jobs that coordinate closely with machinery, while Importance of Repeating Same Tasks picks out jobs with many similar and independent small tasks. Variety picks out an opposite case of dissimilar tasks. The job features Wear Common Safety Equipment and Indoors Environmentally Controlled pick out tasks done in calm stable environments, where machines function better, while Hearing Sensitivity picks out less suitable complex subtle environments. In jobs with frequent Letters and Memos, such memos tend to be short and standardized. Jobs with more Advancement are \u201cresults oriented\u201d, with more clearly measurable results. Simple machines tend to be bad at Thinking Creatively, Innovation and Mathematics. Physical Proximity picks out jobs done close to humans, usually because of needed human interactions, which tend to be complex, and where active machines could risk hurting them.We have long been experiencing a wave of automation passing across the space of job tasks. Some of this increase in automation has been due to falling computer tech costs, improving algorithms and tools, etc. But much of it may simply be the general potential of this tech being realized via a slow steady process with a long delay: the automation of tasks near other recently automated tasks, slowly spreading across the landscape of tasks.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: December 13, 2019 2:20 pm \nTitle: Automation As Colonization Wave\nOur automation data analysis found a few surprising results.

{"completion": " If morality is basically a package of norms, and if norms are systems for making people behave, then each individual\u2019s main moral priority becomes: to avoid blame. While the norm system may be designed to on average produce good outcomes, when that system breaks then each individual has only weak incentives to fix it. They mainly seek to avoid blame according to the current broken system. In this post I\u2019ll discuss an especially disturbing example, via a series of four hypothetical scenarios.1. First, imagine we had a tech that could turn ordinary humans into productive zombies. Such zombies can still do most jobs effectively, but they no longer have feelings or an inner life, and from the outside they also seem dead inside, lacking passion, humor, and liveliness. Imagine that someone proposed to use this tech on a substantial fraction of the human population. That is, they propose to zombify those who do jobs that others see as boring, routine, and low status, like collecting garbage, cleaning bedpans, or sweeping floors. As in this scenario living people would be turned into dead zombies, this proposal would probably be widely seen as genocide, and soundly rejected.2. Second, imagine someone else proposes the following variation: when a new child of a parent seems likely enough to grow up to take such a low status job, this zombie tech is applied very early to the fetus. So no non-zombie humans are killed, they are just prevented from existing. Zombie kids are able to learn and eventually learn to do those low status. Thus technically this is not genocide, though it could be seen as the extermination of a class. And many parents would suffer from losing their chance to raise lively humans.

{"completion": " 3. Third, imagine combining this proposal with another tech that can reliably induce identical twins. This will allow the creation of extra zombie kids. That is, each birth to low status parents is now of identical twins, one of which is an ordinary kid, and the other is a zombie kid. If parent\u2019s don\u2019t want to raise zombie kids, some other organization will take over that task. So now the parents get to have all their usual lively kids, and the world gains a bunch of extra zombie kids who grow up to do low status jobs. Some may support this proposal, but surely many others will find it creepy. I expect that it would be pretty hard to create a political consensus to support this proposal.While in the first scenario people were killed, and in the second scenario parents were deprived, this third scenario is designed to take away these problems. But this third proposal still has two remaining problems. First, if we have a choice between creating an empty zombie and a living feeling person who finds their life worth living, this second option seems to result in a better world. Which argues against zombies. Second, if zombies seem like monsters, supporters of this proposal might might be blamed for creating monsters. And as the zombies look a lot like humans, many will see you as a bad person if you seem inclined to or capable of treating them badly. It looks bad to be willing to create a lower class, and to treat them like a disrespected lower class, if that lower class looks a lot like humans. So by supporting this third proposal, you risk being blamed.4. My fourth and last scenario is designed to split apart these two problems with the third scenario, to make you choose which problem you care more about. Imagine that robots are going to take over most all human jobs, but that we have a choice about which kind of robot they are. We could choose human-like robots, who act lively with passion and humor, and who inside have feelings and an inner life. Or we could choose machine-like robots, who are empty inside and also look empty on the outside, without passion, humor, etc.If you are focused on creating a better world, you\u2019ll probably prefer the human-like robots, as that which choice results in more creatures who find their lives worth living. But if you are focused on avoiding blame, you\u2019ll probably prefer the machine-like robots, as few will blame you for for that choice. In that choice the creatures you create look so little like humans that few will blame you for creating such creatures, or for treating them badly.I recently ran a 24 hour poll on Twitter about this choice, a poll to which 700 people responded. Of those who make a choice, 77% picked the machine-like robots:\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: November 7, 2018 7:30 pm \nTitle: Avoiding Blame By Preventing Life\nIf morality is basically a package of norms, and if norms are systems for making people behave, then each individual\u2019s main moral priority becomes: to avoid blame.

{"completion": " Humans are often willing to suffer large costs to punish those who violate their moral rules. In fact, we probably evolved such moral indignation in part as a way to commit to punishing violations of our local moral norms. In small bands, with norms that were stable across many generations, members could plausibly achieve sufficient clarity and certainty about norm enforcement to deter violations via such threats. So such commitments might have had good plans in that context.But this does not imply that things would typically go well for us if we freely indulged our moral indignation inclinations in our complex modern world. For example, imagine that we encouraged, instead of discouraged, mob justice. That is, if we encouraged people to gossip to convince their friends to share their moral outrange, building off of each until they chased down and \u201clynched\u201d any who offended them.This sort of mob justice can go badly for a great many reasons. We don\u2019t actually share norms as closely as we think, mob members are often more eager to show loyalty to each other than to verify accusation accuracy, and some are willing to make misleading accusations to take down rivals. More fundamentally, we might say that mob justice goes bad because it is not based on a good commitment plan. Observers just can\u2019t predict mob justice outcomes well enough for it to usefully encourage good behavior, at least compared to a formal legal system.Now consider the subject of making peace deals to end wars. Such as the current war between Russia and Ukraine. An awful lot of people, probably a majority, of the Ukrainian supporters I\u2019ve heard from seem to be morally offended by the idea of such a peace deal in this case. Even though the usual game theory analyses of war say that there are usually peace deals that both sides would prefer at the time to continued war. (Such deals could focus on immediately verifiable terms; they needn\u2019t focus on unverifiable promises of future actions. In April 2022 Russia and Ukraine\u00a0apparently had a tentative deal, scuttled due to pressure from Ukrainian allies.)Many of these peace deal opponents are willing to justify this stance in consequentialist terms: they say that we should commit to not making such deals. Which, as they are eager to point out, is a logically coherent stance due to the usual game theory analysis. We should thus \u201chold firm\u201d, \u201cteach them a lesson\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t let them get away with it\u201d, etc. All justified by game theory, they say.The problem is, I haven\u2019t seen anyone outline anything close to a good commitment plan here. Nothing remotely as clear and simple as we have with criminal law, or with mutually assured destruction. They don\u2019t clearly specify the set of situations where the commitment is to apply, the ways observers are to tell when they are in such situations, the behavior that has been committed to there, or the dataset of international events that shows that people that look like us have in fact consistently behaved in this way. Peace deal opponents (sometimes called \u201cwar mongers\u201d) instead mainly just seem to point to their mob-inflamed feelings of moral outrage.For example, some talk as if we should just ignore the fact that Russia has nuclear weapons in this war, as if we have somehow committed to doing that in order to prevent anyone from using nuclear weapons as a negotiating leverage. The claim that nations have been acting according to such a commitment doesn\u2019t seem to me at all a good summary of the history of nuclear powers. And if the claim is that we should start now to create such a commitment by just acting as if it had always existed, that seems even crazier.If we have not actually found and clearly implemented a good commitment plan, then it seems to me that we should proceed as if we have not made such a commitment. So we must act in accord with the usual game theory analysis. Which says to compromise and make peace if possible. Especially as a way to reduce the risk of a large nuclear war.The possibility of a global nuclear war seems a very big deal. Yes, war seems sacred and that inclines us toward relying on our intuitions instead of conscious calculations. It inclines us toward mob war strategy. But this issue seems plenty important enough to justify our resisting that inclination. Yes, a careful analysis may well identify some good commitment plans, after which we could think about how to move toward making commitments according to those plans.But following the vague war strategy inclinations of our mob-inflamed moral outrage seems a poor substitute for such a good plan. If we have not yet actually found and implemented a good plan, we should deal with a world where we have not made useful commitments. And so make peace, to avoid risking the destructions of war.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: September 25, 2022 10:10 pm \nTitle: Beware Mob War Strategy\nThe game theory is clear: it can be in your interest to make threats that it would not be in your interest to carry out.

These problems are recognized and in many cases overcome by deliberative practitioners and practice. \u2026 The prospects for benign deployment are good to the degree that deliberative scholars and practitioners have established relationships with political leaders and publics\u2014as opposed to being turned to in desperation in a crisis.So ordinary people are capable of fair and thoughtful deliberation, but only via expensive processes carefully managed in detail by, and designed well in advance by, proper deliberation experts with \u201cestablished relationships with political leaders and publics.\u201d That is, these experts must be free to pick the \u201cbalance\u201d of info, experts, and participants included, and even who speaks when how, and these experts must be treated with proper respect and deference by the public and by political authorities.No, they aren\u2019t offering a simple well-tested mechanism (e.g., an auction) that we can apply elsewhere with great confidence that the deployed mechanism is the same as the one that they tested. Because what they tested instead was a mechanism with a lot of \u201cknobs\u201d that need context-specific turning; they tested the result of having particular experts use a lot of discretion to make particular political and info choices in particular contexts. They say that went well, and their academic peer reviewers (mostly the same people) agreed. So we shouldn\u2019t worry that such experts would become corrupted if we gave them a lot more power.This sure sounds like a priesthood to me. If we greatly empower and trust a deliberation priesthood, presumably overseen by these 20 high priest authors and their associates, they promise to create events wherein ordinary people talk much more reasonably, outputting policy recommendations that we could then all defer to with more confidence. At least if we trust them.In contrast, I\u2019ve been suggesting that we empower and trust prediction markets on key policy outcomes. We\u2019ve tested such mechanisms a lot, including in contexts with strong incentives to corrupt them, and these mechanisms have far fewer knobs that must be set by experts with discretion.

Quoting Zac Gochenour:The typical human body has a muscle to fat ratio similar to a bear, which is about 770 calories per pound. If the average post-apocalyptic person weighs about 130 lbs and is a bit leaner than a bear (say 600 calories per pound), throw away say 20 lbs of bones and 20 lbs of inedible organs, leaves you with about 54000 calories. Assuming 1200 calories a day for survival, that\u2019s 45 person days per human body. 1200 may be too high; I\u2019ve read concentration camp prisoners survived for months on about 300-500 calories per day, engaged in some degree of hard labor.I figure the biggest problem facing such a population would be lack of essential nutrients. Vitamin C, for instance. The way the eskimos (who traditionally ate a diet consisting almost entirely on meat and fish) dealt with this is by eating their meat raw and keeping the vitamin C in tact. The cannibals would have to do the same.\u201dEven at a rate of 100 person days per body, that would use up 1% of the population per day. \u00a0An initial population of 100 million, killed off at this rate, would have only one person left after five years.  In the novel there were many corpses around that clearly hadn\u2019t been eaten; if only half the bodies were eaten, the population would last half as long.  No way a kid lives to be seven when born into a world where the main food is cannibalism.Given how lauded and celebrated is this book, didn\u2019t anyone else has pointed these out before? (The novel\u00a0Blindness dealt with similar sort of issues, but assumed a more realistic timescale.)Added 29 May: Henry Farrell did say in \u201907:I agree on the campness of the broiled baby, and even more so of the amputees in the cellar. The latter annoyed me, in part because my sfnal instincts made me ask practical questions- how is this kind of cannibalism sustainable \u2013 presumably you\u2019ve got to feed your victims something if you want to keep them alive, which sort of defeats the purpose of the thing (far smarter, if you adopt the logic of the cannibals to just butcher em and smoke em).\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: May 26, 2010 11:00 am \nTitle: Cannibals Die Fast\nI just watched the movie The Road, and then skimmed the book.

If a successful challenger can explain well enough how they managed to evade your defenses, then they might get 2N gold coins or more. Coin redeemers may be suspected of being tied to a real assassin, and so they must agree to opening themselves to being investigated in extra depth, and if still deemed suspicious enough they might be banned from ever using a challenge coin again. But they still get their gold coins this time. Some who issue challenge coins might try to hide transmitters in them, but holders could just wrap coins in aluminum foil and dip them in plastic to limit odor emissions. I estimate that challenge coins are legal, and not prohibited by asset or gambling regulations.This same approach could be used by the TSA to show everyone how hard it is to slip unapproved items past TSA security. Just reveal your coin and your unapproved item right after you exit TSA security. You could also use this approach to convince an audience that your accounting books are clean; anyone with a coin can point to any particular item in your books, and demand an independent investigation of that item, paid for at the coin-issuer\u2019s expense. If the item is found to not be as it should, the coin holder gets the announced prize; otherwise they just lose their coin.In general, issuing challenge coins is a way to show an audience what rate of detection success (or security failure) results from what level of financial incentives. (The audience will need to see data on the rates of coin sales and successful vs. unsuccessful redemptions.) We presume that the larger the payoff to a successful challenge, the higher the fraction of coins that successfully result in a detection (or security failure).\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: October 2, 2018 3:15 pm \nTitle: Challenge Coins\nImagine you are a king of old, afraid of being assassinated.

Industry needs people to frequently change where they live, what kinds of jobs they do, and who they work with, and to play fair within industry-era reimagined firms, cities, and nations.

Our descendants are likely to similarly forgo advantages from new ways to cooperate, if those similarly reduce future flexibility and specialization. For example, future societies of brain emulations are likely to be wary of strongly self-cooperating clans of copies of the same original human. While such copy clans have even stronger reasons to cooperate with each other than family clans, copy clans might cause future organizations to suffer even more than do family-based firms, cities, and nations today from clan-based nepotism, and from low quality and inflexible matches of skills to jobs. Ems firms and cities are thus likely to be especially watchful for clan nepotism, and to avoid relying too heavily on any one clan.Yes game theory captures important truths about human behavior, including about costs we pay from failing to fully cooperate. But prisoner\u2019s dilemma style failures to cooperate in simple games comprises only a tiny fraction of all the important things that can and do go wrong in a modern economy.

For example, future folks might interact via quantum games, future AIs might show each other their source code, or future clans of em copies might super-cooperate with one another. Folks who know just enough economics to be dangerous sometimes say that this \u201cchanges everything\u201d, i.e., that future economies will be completely different as a result. In fact, however, not only do we already have lots decent ways to encourage cooperation, such as talking and reputation, we also consistently forgo such ways to better encourage flexibility and specialization.As I reviewed in my last post, we have strong reasons and abilities to cooperate within family clans, especially when such clans heavily intermarry and live and work closely together over many generations. And our farming era ancestors took big advantage of this. To function and thrive, however, our industry era economy had to suppress such clans, to allow more flexibility and specialization. Industry needs people to frequently change where they live, what kinds of jobs they do, and who they work with, and to play fair within industry-era reimagined firms, cities, and nations. Strong family clans instead encouraged stability and nepotism, and discouraged people from moving to cities and new jobs, and from cooperating fairly with and showing sufficient loyalty to other families within shared firms, cities, and nations.\n\n###\n\n"}

{"completion": " In their attempt to answer normative questions that the science of economics could not address, economists opened the door to economic ideologues who lacked any commitment to scientific integrity. Among these pretend economists, the ones who prized supposed freedom (especially freedom from regulation) over all other concerns proved most useful \u2026\u00a0 When the stakes were high, firms sought out these ideologues to act as their representatives and further their agenda. And just like their more reputable peers, these pretend economists used the unfamiliar language of economics to obscure the moral judgments that undergirded their advice. \u2026Throughout his entire career, Greenspan worked to give financial institutions more leeway \u2026 If economists continue to let people like him define their discipline, the public will send them back to the basement, and for good reason. \u2026The alternative is to make honesty and humility prerequisites for membership in the community of economists. The easy part is to challenge the pretenders. The hard part is to say no when government officials look to economists for an answer to a normative question. Scientific authority never conveys moral authority. No economist has a privileged insight into questions of right and wrong, and none deserves a special say in fundamental decisions about how society should operate. Economists who argue otherwise and exert undue influence in public debates about right and wrong should be exposed for what they are: frauds. (more)Oddly, Romer is famous for advocating \u201ccharter city\u201d experiments, which can be seen as a big way to escape from the usual regulations.So how does Romer suggest we identify \u201cpretend\u201d economists who are to be \u201cexposed as frauds\u201d and \u201cpublicly expelled from economists\u2019 ranks\u201d? He seems to say they are problematic on big but not small issues because firms bribe them, but he admits some are well-meaning, and doesn\u2019t accuse Greenspan of taking bribes. So I doubt he\u2019d settle for expelling only those who are clearly bribed.\u00a0That seems to leave only the fact that they argue for less regulation when common moral intuitions call for more. (Especially when they mention \u201cfreedom\u201d.) Perhaps he wants economists to be expelled when they argue for deregulation, or perhaps when they offer economic analysis contrary to moral intuitions. Both sound terrible to me as intellectual standards.Look, people quite often express \u201cmoral\u201d opinions that are combinations of simple moral intuitions together with intuitions about how social systems work. If they are mistaken about that second part, and if we can gain separate estimates on their moral intuitions, then economic analysis has the potential to produce superior combinations.This is exactly what economists try to do when applying value of life estimates, and this can also be done regarding deregulation. The key point is that when people act on their moral intuitions, then we can use their actions to estimate their morals, and thus include their moral weights in our analysis.In particular, I don\u2019t find it obviously wrong to let for-profit firms market drugs to doctors, nor do I think it remotely obvious that this is the main cause of a consistent four-decade rise in drug deaths.Yes of course, it is a problem if professionals can be bribed to give particular recommendations. But in most of these disputes parties on many sides are willing to offer such distorting rewards. My long-standing recommendation is to use conditional betting markets to induce more honest advice from such professionals, but so far few support that.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: February 13, 2020 11:45 am \nTitle: Defrock Deregulation Economists?\nRecent economics Nobel prize winner Paul Romer is furious that economists have sometimes argued for deregulation; he wants them \u201cdefrocked\u201d, & cast from the profession:\u00a0New generation of economists argued that tweaks \u2026 would enable the market to regulate itself, obviating the need for stringent government oversight. \u2026 To regain the public\u2019s trust, economists should \u2026 emphasize the limits of their knowledge \u2026 even if it requires them to publicly expel from their ranks any member of the community who habitually overreaches. \u2026Consider the rapid spread of cost-benefit analysis \u2026 Lacking clear guidance from voters, legislators, regulators, and judges turned to economists, who resolved the uncertainty by [estimating] \u2026 the amount that society should spend to save a life. \u2026 [This] seems to have worked out surprisingly well \u2026 The trouble arose when the stakes were higher \u2026 it is all too easy for a firm \u2026 to arrange for a pliant pretend economist to \u2026 [defend them] with a veneer of objectivity and scientific expertise. \u2026Imagine making the following proposal in the 1950s: Give for-profit firms the freedom to develop highly addictive painkillers and to promote them via \u2026 marketing campaigns targeted at doctors.

Costs \u2013 All else equal, it is harder to be honest on more and wider topics, on topics where people tend to have emotional attachments, and on topics close to the key bias issues of the value and morality of you and your associates and rivals. You can reasonably expect to be honest about a wide range of topics that few people care much about, but only on a few narrow topics where many people care lots. The close you get to dangerous topics, the smaller your focus of honesty can\u00a0be. You can\u2019t be both a generalist and a rationalist; specialize in something.3. Contamination \u2013 You should try to avoid dependencies between your beliefs on focus topics where you will try to protect your honesty, and the topics where you are prone to bias. Try not to have your opinions on focus topics depend on a belief that you or your associates are especially smart, perceptive, or moral. If you must think on risky topics about people, try to first study other people you don\u2019t care much about. If you must have\u00a0an opinion on\u00a0yourself, assume you are like most other\u00a0people.4.

Instead of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, step onto higher ground.

The more you can create personal direct costs of\u00a0your dishonesty, the more honest you will become. And if you get paid to work on a certain topic, maybe you should give up on honesty about\u00a0who if anyone should be paid to do that.So my advice is to choose a focus for your honesty, a narrow enough focus to have a decent chance at achieving honesty. Make your focus\u00a0more narrow\u00a0the more dangerous is your focus area. Try to insulate beliefs on your focus topics from beliefs on risky\u00a0topics like your own value, and try to arrange things so you will be penalized for dishonesty.

Inequality exists between different species, between generations born at different times, and between nations of the world at a time. Within a nation at a time, there is inequality both between families and within families. There is also inequality across the moments of the life of each person. In all of these cases, there is not only financial inequality, but also inequality in status, prestige, pleasure, lifespan, happiness, and more. There is also inequality between the size of families, firms, cities, or nations, even when individuals within those groupings are equal.Today, we have relatively little intentional redistribution between generations or between nations. Redistribution within the moments of a person\u2019s life happens, but that is mostly left to that person to choose and to fund. Similarly, redistribution between siblings is mostly achieved via differential treatment by parents.

{"completion": " This standard inequality looks at differences in average individual financial incomes between the families of a nation, all at a given time. This type of inequality is actually one of the smallest. For example, in the U.S. today financial inequality between families is only one third the size of that inequality between siblings within families, and even that is much less than the inequality between individuals from different nations. We may focus our redistribution feelings on this standard inequality because it seems to us the most analogous to the inequality that forager sharing norms addressed. Alternatively, perhaps it is the most profitable type of redistribution for opportunistic rent-seekers.This history suggests that the em world will have little redistribution between em generations or city states, and also that each clan is mostly in charge of deciding how to address inequality within that clan. After all, em clan members are more similar and closer to each other than are human siblings, even if they may sometimes be more distant from each other than are typical human life moments. Also, clan members have rather complex relations with each other, making it hard pick a natural sub-clan unit to be the standard basis for counting inequality. So that leaves ems with comparing inequality between clans.A set of em clans can be unequal in two different ways. One way focuses on individual incomes, or perhaps individual happiness or respect, and says that a clan is better off if its individuals are on average better off. The other way focuses on the overall size and success of a clan. Here a clan is better off if it has more members, resources, or respect. Historically, most redistribution efforts have focused on average individual outcomes. For example, we have seen very little efforts to redistribute between human family clans based on family size. That is, we almost never take from families with many descendants in order to give to families that have few descendants. Nor do we take much from big nations, cities, or firms to give to smaller ones.Because most em wages are near subsistence levels, unregulated wages have less inequality than do wages today. So em clans naturally have less inequality of the standard sort that is the focus of today\u2019s redistribution. In contrast, em clans have enormous inequality in clan size, resources, and respect. However, history gives little reason to expect much redistribution to address this inequality. It is not very analogous to forager sharing, nor does it lend itself to profitable rent-seeking.Thus the main kind of redistribution that we have reason to expect in the em era is between the clans of a city, based on differences of average within-clan individual income. But we expect less inequality of this sort in the em world, and so expect less redistribution on this basis.Income taxes are today one of our main mechanisms for reducing the standard inequality that compares individual incomes between families within a nation. Over the last two centuries, big increases in the top marginal tax rates have mostly followed wars where over two percent of the population served in the military. For example, in the U.S. the top marginal tax rate jumped from 15% to 67% in 1917, during World War I. Controlling for this effect, top tax increases have not been correlated with wealth, democracy, or the political ideology of the party running the government. This weakly suggests that the local degree of individual income redistribution between the clans of an em city may depend on the local frequency of large expensive em wars.If ordinary humans are included straightforwardly in the redistribution systems of the em world, then the simple result to expect is transfers, not only away from richer humans, but also from humans to ems overall. After all, in purely financial terms typical ems are poorer than the poorest humans. Redistribution systems may perhaps correct for the fact that em subsistence levels are much lower than are human subsistence levels. But if so such systems may also encourage or even require recipients of aid to switch from being a human to being an em, in order to lower costs.During the em era, humans typically have industrial era incomes, which are much higher than subsistence level incomes. While many and perhaps most humans may pay to create a few ems, they tend to endow them with much higher than subsistence incomes. In contrast, a small number of successful humans manage to give rise to large em clans, and within these clans most members have near subsistence incomes. Thus transfers based on individual income inequality take from the descendants of less successful humans and give to descendants of more successful humans.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: July 17, 2015 9:30 am \nTitle: Em Redistribution\nI\u2019m in the last few weeks of finishing my book The Age of Em:\u00a0Work, Love, and Life When Robots Rule The Earth, about social outcomes in a world dominated by\u00a0brain emulations.

And firms and cities within the nations that hold all those bad people that you think good nations are focused on excluding don\u2019t have firm- or city-wide exclusion policies either.Furthermore, many multinational firms today already have employees who are spread across a great many nations, nations that vary a lot in wealth, development, etc. Yet such multinationals usually don\u2019t have much in the way of centralized limits on who can be hired by their divisions in different firms, nor on who can be transferred between such divisions. These firms may face limits imposed by nations, but they seem to mostly lament such limits, and aren\u2019t eager to add more.Firms and cities live in more competitive environments than do nations. So we should expect their behavior to be shaped more by competitive pressures. Thus we can conclude that competitive entities tend not to create entity-wide limits on who can enter them; they are mostly content to let smaller parts of them made those decisions.So if nations act differently from firms and cities, that should be because either:1) there are big important effects that are quite different at the national level, than at firm and city levels, or2) nations are failing to adopt policies that competition would induce, if they faced more competition.My bet is on the latter.

{"completion": " Prestige \u2013 When data on customer results isn\u2019t available, we may rely on a general opinion based on many weak clues about the quality of relevant people and orgs. For people, such clues include wealth, attractiveness, intelligence, social savvy, well-connectedness, etc. For orgs, there is also name-recognition, sponsorships, prestigious projects, and many other elements. Early education and training varies in prestige and adds to individual prestige. When individuals affiliate with orgs, the prestige of each adds to the prestige of the other. I count network effects under prestige; you use the system everyone else respects, As prestige is usually pretty stable over time, suppliers chosen by prestige tend to have a secure position.Loyalty \u2013 While we less often admit it, we often choose suppliers to show our loyalty to \u201cour sides\u201d. Those we choose make sure to signal which sides they are on, and we help to ensure that our associates see those signals, so they can credit us for loyalty. It matters less to us that these signals actually correlate with the things we claim that our side seeks to achieve, as long as they are widely seen as clearly marking folks as on our side relative to other sides. The more stable are sides and signals, the more security a supplier can gain by clearly picking a side.Procedure \u2013 Often specialists create official procedures re how to do something, and rules saying what not to do along the way. Then suppliers can brag to customers that they follow good procedures, they may be required by regulators to do so, and may be punished by courts as negligent if they deviate. Civil servants, for example, are typically paid and promoted based on following official procedures, and on internal politics, not on rates or results. Divisions within private orgs also try to become silos evaluated via rules and procedures, not results. Suppliers tend to like being evaluated by stable rules and procedures that can be achieved with limited effort, as this ensures high job/supplier stability.While all these methods have their place, the first one, results, seems the most solid and hardest to corrupt from the customers\u2019 point of view. Yes there are obstacles to applying it widely, but such problems are often exaggerated to excuse the other methods. Suppliers would generally rather be evaluated via prestige, loyalty, and procedure, as once these are established they can usually look forward to long stable lucrative relationships, unthreatened by upstart competitors.I want to find ways to tell people that we could pay for results far more than we now do. Yes, suppliers would resist such a switch, but we customers would get more of what we wanted.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: May 19, 2020 9:05 pm \nTitle: Five Ways to Rate\nWhen we have people and orgs do things for us, we need ways to rate them.

{"completion": " Today I want to consider what this theory implies about our future. First, it implies that if we continue to get richer, we should continue to see attitude changes in roughly the same directions. We should expect continued movement toward accepting school and workplace domination and ranking, and whatever other attitudes greatly enable industry to create wealth.  And regarding how we spend our increased wealth, we should expect a continued shift from farmer to forager style attitudes for a while. For example, we should expect less war and physical cruelty to\u00a0humans and animals, and more forager-like sexual promiscuity and respect for the environment. This should make us feel more happy, relaxed, and natural. In the extreme, we might even end up (for a time) as foragers in bands wandering virtual robot-supported forests, absent predators, famines, or pandemics.Yet in the long run, if our interactions remain competitive, we shouldn\u2019t expect forager behavior to be anything like the most adaptive for our descendants\u2019 future worlds. Neither should farming of course, but one might still wonder which offers the best basis for generating adaptation to those future worlds. And on that criteria, the farming style seem more promising.  Its not so much that farming ways adapted to a larger social world, more like the large social worlds we expect for our descendants. Its more that farming adapted at all \u2013 farming found ways to push foragers, whose ways had been changing very slowly by farming standards, rather quickly into doing quite unnatural things.  So farming meta-innovations, like religion,\u00a0honor, politeness, etc., might well be usefully repurposed to get our descendants to adapt to even stranger future environments.For example,\u00a0ems, or whole brain emulations, are my best guess for the next big transition on the order of the farming and industry transitions.  Farmer-style stoicism, self-sacrifice, and self-control, detached as needed from farmer specifics like love of land or sexual monogamy, might well be more effective at creating acceptance of em-efficient lifestyles. Religious ems might, for example, better accept being deleted when new more efficient versions of themselves are introduced. \u201cOnward Christian robots\u201d might be the new sensibility. And em\u2019s low incomes might help farmer-style\u00a0fear-based norm-enforcement to gain traction.Perhaps you hope that an industry-refashioned forager style might adapt just as well to these new requirements. \u00a0But wishing won\u2019t make it so.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: October 7, 2010 12:00 pm \nTitle: Forage vs Farm Future\nThe two biggest events of last million years, by far, are the transition from foraging to farming and then from farming to industry.

More traditional modes of prediction have proved astonishingly bad, yet they continue to run our economic and political worlds, often straight into the ground. Bubbles do occur, and we can all point to examples of markets getting blindsided.

More traditional modes of prediction have proved astonishingly bad, yet they continue to run our economic and political worlds, often straight into the ground. Bubbles do occur, and we can all point to examples of markets getting blindsided. But if prediction markets are on balance more accurate and unbiased, they should still be an attractive policy tool, rather than a discarded idea tainted with the odor of unseemliness. As Hanson asks, \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want a more accurate source?\u201dMaybe most people. What motivates us to vote, opine, and prognosticate is often not the desire for efficacy or accuracy in worldly affairs\u2014the things that prediction markets deliver\u2014but instead the desire to send signals to each other about who we are. Humans remain intensely tribal. We choose groups to associate with, and we try hard to show everybody which groups we belong to.

Since bikes share the narrow path with pedestrians, I ring a bell as I come behind pedestrians going in the same direction.  When there are several of them together, it is safest if they all move to the same side of the path; this gives the most distance between the bike and then nearest pedestrian.  Sometimes, however, a group splits, with some of them moving to one side and some moving to the other side.  Then I have to slow down more in order to safely move between them.We can interpret the desired behavior here as following a \u201cgroup norm\u201d, i.e., a social norm that specifies the behavior of groups, rather than the behavior of individuals.  An individual norm might be to move to the side of the path when you hear a bike bell, while a group norm might be to move your group together to one side of the path when you hear a bike bell.It seems to me that while asians are a minority of the pedestrian groups on my path, they are the majority of the groups who split, moving to both sides of the path.  This suggests that asians are less familiar with the concept of a group norm, at least for informal groups like \u201cpeople walking together on a path.\u201d  I asked an asian friend who confirmed this \u2013 they couldn\u2019t think of an asian group norm.

{"completion": " I\u2019ve been teaching for over two decades, but haven\u2019t yet posted much on my theoretical view of school. Talking recently to an entering education Ph.D. student has inspired me to fill that gap.The obvious usual purpose for school is to help people learn how to do useful tasks in life. And the obvious way to help with that is to show students various useful tools, show examples of their use, and then have students practice trying related tasks with related tools. Finally, score students on how well they do these practice tasks, to help others judge their suitability for various positions.In this view, the big question is: how far and in what ways should school tasks differ from the later life tasks for which students are preparing? School tasks can differ from life tasks in many ways, such as in how long they take, how wide a scope of subproblems they encompass, how clearly performance on them can be judged, how many others have previously completed similar tasks, how connected each new task is to one\u2019s recent tasks, what sort of teams take on tasks, and what sort of other distractions one must deal with while working on each task.It seem obvious to me that school tasks must differ greatly from life tasks, at least when kids are young. It is also obvious that choosing school tasks well is hard, but that this can offer huge gains. We should search well the vast space of possibilities for the best student tasks.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: June 12, 2021 8:00 pm \nTitle: How School Goes Wrong\n\n###\n\n"}
{"completion": " Furthermore, it seems obvious that student tasks often complement each other strongly. Often learning one task helps a lot in learning another task. So we want all the tasks that students eventually take on to fit into a total package where the parts fit well together, and where that package fits well with later life tasks. Which can justify a lot of coordination between the teaching of related topics, and between schools and those who manage life tasks. In addition, there are often scale and scope economies from having many students do similar tasks, especially regarding evaluation. (This coordination isn\u2019t obviously better when governments run schools.)Our simplest general task tool is inference, supported by related \u201cfacts\u201d. That is, one tells students about key facts related to a task class, and shows them examples of drawing relevant inferences from such facts. This \u201cbook learning\u201d is far from the only useful tool, but it is useful often enough to make fact-telling a big fraction of learning for most topics. Yes, it is somewhat possible to teach better general inference, but the scope for this seems vastly overrated.Not only is it hard to choose the package of learning tasks well, it is even harder for non-experts to judge the quality of such packages. And even when one can judge the quality of particular school tasks, their fitting together into large integrated packages makes it hard to push for particular changes. (Such as the long-overdue switch from geometry to statistics in high school.) If schools competed fiercely on measured student outcomes, they might try harder to find the best packages. But such outcomes are usually not measured well, and many schools are funded and managed by customers who are not very outcome-oriented.The net result is that teachers and schools can have a lot of slack regarding their choices of student tasks and supporting tools. Which suggests that schools may allow other priorities, besides preparing students for life tasks, to influence their choices. For example, when the world changes, teachers with status tied to their expertise regarding particular student tasks may have insufficient incentives to change those tasks to better fit a changed world. As another example, teachers who seek to push ideologies may over-emphasize teaching facts, and try to infuse those ideologies into the facts they present, even when that cuts student performance.When schools face stronger selection pressures regarding the perceived quality of their students, relative to preparing students for life tasks, then such schools may pick tasks with less evaluation noise and higher perceived prestige, even if those tasks help less for common life tasks. Especially for students likely to go into industries where the main product sold to customers is affiliation with worker prestige. In that case, schools mainly just need to agree on how to prestige is measured, and then pick school tasks that fit well with those prestige concepts. Here the social value of such schooling seems far less than its private value; we should tax, not subsidize, such school.When accusations of teacher bias are important, schools may emphasize tasks that can be more clearly and objectively evaluated, even if those tasks are otherwise less useful. And when an accusation of school bias against particular subgroups is salient, schools may emphasize tasks on which those particular subgroups do better. Some have suggested that accusations of bias against girls has induced schools to switch more to tasks on where girls do better. (Even though the direct measured biases seems\u00a0to be against boys.)Over the last few decades there seems to have been a move away from giving students \u201chard\u201d tasks, where one cannot offer clear procedures to follow to succeed. On such hard tasks, teachers show students related tools and examples of prior successful performance, and can offer suggestions on how to improve tasks in progress. But students must flounder and search for how to achieve excellence, and most students will not so achieve. Some have claimed that such hard tasks favor boys, who are less risk-averse.One of the main tasks for grad students is to write research papers. And my grad classes are focused overwhelmingly on this task. This is a hard task, where many will fail, and where evaluations are more subjective. And it is a big task chunk, which takes a long time and is not easily broken down into subtasks that can be evaluated independently. But it is also a task clearly and directly relevant to their future life, at least if they move near academic circles. While academics are willing to water down many school tasks to satisfy various outside pressures, they have so far drawn the line at how they train their own replacements.When teaching undergrads, I usually split the class grade into four quizzes and four short papers. The quizzes are more fact-based, and have more parts and thus less noise in their overall evaluation. With quizzes, I more give students what they, their parents, and their schools want. The papers are harder and have more evaluation noise, but are closer to a life task that I value: using economic tools to argue for a policy position of their choice on a topic that I choose. For papers, I grade using a point system designed to ignore my personal opinions on paper topics.My teaching strategy roughly matches my theory of teaching; I get as close as I can to having my students practice a real life task related to the class topic that I have been assigned. Even if those tasks are hard, even if that makes my evaluations of students more noisy, and even if students like it less. I accept that schools have mostly devolved to sorting students by prestige, instead of preparing them for life tasks.

Talking recently to an entering education Ph.D. student has inspired me to fill that gap.The obvious usual purpose for school is to help people learn how to do useful tasks in life. And the obvious way to help with that is to show students various useful tools, show examples of their use, and then have students practice trying related tasks with related tools. Finally, score students on how well they do these practice tasks, to help others judge their suitability for various positions.In this view, the big question is: how far and in what ways should school tasks differ from the later life tasks for which students are preparing? School tasks can differ from life tasks in many ways, such as in how long they take, how wide a scope of subproblems they encompass, how clearly performance on them can be judged, how many others have previously completed similar tasks, how connected each new task is to one\u2019s recent tasks, what sort of teams take on tasks, and what sort of other distractions one must deal with while working on each task.It seem obvious to me that school tasks must differ greatly from life tasks, at least when kids are young. It is also obvious that choosing school tasks well is hard, but that this can offer huge gains. We should search well the vast space of possibilities for the best student tasks.\n\n###\n\n"}

{"completion": " But they all knew, at least subconsciously, that some groups would be quite effective at retaliating against such suggestions. The accused might physically resist the attempted punishment, or might retaliate with contrary accusations.\u00a0So foragers needed ways not only to overtly accuse folks of violating norms, and to officially propose to take stuff away as punishment, but also to covertly discuss who might have especially nice stuff to take, and who they could most easily get away with grabbing from.I suggest that most talk about the problems of inequality actually invokes this ancient hypocritical ability to covertly discuss where to find lots of nice easy-to-grab stuff. We don\u2019t discuss inequalities across time, because it is hard to grab much more than we do from the past or the future. We don\u2019t much discuss the inequality of rich foreigners, because it is much harder to grab their stuff. We don\u2019t much discuss inequality of those with unusual artistic abilities or sexual attractiveness, because we can\u2019t directly grab their advantages and while we might try to grab their material goods to compensate, they don\u2019t have that much, and the grabbing would be hard. (Also, such folks have more social status to resist with. For foragers, status counted lots more than material goods for influence.)A few people within our nation who each have lots and lots of material goods, however, seem to make a great target for grabbing. So people discover they have a deep moral concern about that particular inequality, and ponder what oh what could we possibly do to rectify this situation? Anyone have an idea? Anyone?But if those few very rich folks had real physical super-powers, we would be a lot more afraid of their simple physical retaliation. They might be very effective at physically resisting our attempts to take their stuff. So somehow, conveniently, we just wouldn\u2019t find that their unequal wealth evoked as much deeply felt important-social-issue-in-need-of-discussing moral concern in us.

The idea is that we do not yet possess the concepts to bridge this gap (although one day we may).\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: February 23, 2022 9:30 pm \nTitle:  J. Phil.

{"completion": " To which I respond: yes of course, we\u2019ve long known this. The only data we seem to have about consciousness is the fact that many of us feel compelled to believe that some part of us is at that current moment conscious, even as we each feel unsure re the status of everyone and everything else, of ourselves in the past or future, or even of other parts of ourselves at this moment. So even though by assumption a WBE would also feel compelled to believe that part of it was conscious, the rest of us would feel unsure of that. And until we find some other data (and we can\u2019t even imagine what such data could be), this is how the situation must remain. But we\u2019ve long known this.The paper\u2019s second claim is that creating WBE gets harder the more brain cell details that we need to scan and emulate:We have good evidence that some sub-connectomic properties do matter for psychology. \u2026 increases in (e.g.,) testosterone plainly do affect a wide range of behavior, \u2026 the idea that neural properties are not the functional realizers of the mind is, at the very least, very surprising. \u2026 subneural functionalist is also rather destructive to the idea that WBE is the best chance to achieve Superintelligence or immortality. \u2026 the more low-level the functional properties are, the more we will need to know (and the more information we would need to upload), meaning we would be much further away from achieving uploading. \u2026 If more than the connectome matters, if instead lower-level, finer grained details, such as ones that involve neurochemical elements, or other substances that correspond to our \u201chardware\u201d are germane, then the road to emulation is much less clear.Every discussion of WBE that I\u2019ve ever seen (and I\u2019ve seen them for over three decades) considers how much within-neuron structure will need to be scanned and emulated, and all such discussions have accepted that more details requires more work and delays the likely arrival date of WBE. Most everyone has also expected that the topology of neuron connections would be insufficient. So I don\u2019t see why that claim is at all \u201csurprising\u201d.The paper\u2019s third claim is that an unconscious WBE would be useless as a superintelligence:As human capital is the central driver of economic growth, having large amounts of readily available human-level intelligences will make for enormous technological and societal enhancement. \u2026 Say the Biological Theory is only true for phenomenal consciousness. Could the rest of cognition then be captured by the connectome, in which case WBE could still lead to superintelligence? The question turns, in part, on whether there can be intentionality without phenomenology. \u2026. But could there also motivation, or desire, without any phenomenology? \u2026 If they have no motivations, then they will not do anything on their own. \u2026 If uploads lacked beliefs and desires, then they would just be giant calculators that we neither know how to control nor understand the mechanics of. \u2026 if uploads don\u2019t have the normal attitudes, we will have no idea how motivate them to do anything \u2026 One may argue that cars and calculators do things without being motivated, but they do so at the behest of intelligent, motivated designers and users.By definition, a WBE is a device with the same input-output behavior as a source human brain, and thus can be hooked up to artificial eyes, hands etc. to seem to act just as would its source human in the same situation. So it seems that employers could hire such a WBE to do jobs, just as they would have done with the source human. They could, if they wanted, select, train, instruct, incentivize, and monitor such WBE employees in exactly the same ways that they would have done with the source human as an employee. (They also have new options, that I discuss in my book Age of Em.)This paper claims complains, however, that such WBE employees suffer from a fatal flaw: even though they seem to be able to do their jobs via having beliefs and motivations, they would actually only be using fake-beliefs and fake-motivations. Yet I fail to see how this prevents society from using WBE as effectively as we use other humans today, as a substitute for human capital to drive economic growth. Today, employers never know, nor need to know, if their employees have real or fake beliefs or motivations. Teachers never need to know if their students have real or fake beliefs. Armies never know if their soldiers have real or fake motivations. And so on. By definition WBE would claim to feel, and whether they really feel seems irrelevant to whether they can function in society.QED.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: February 23, 2022 9:30 pm \nTitle:  J.

The converse is that the traditional values and social controls necessary for the proper maintenance of human civilization during the millennia of the ploughman have come under attack, and those who defend them style themselves conservatives and reactionaries. Ironically the flowering of the individualist ethos has resulted in a reversion to the relative lack of mass conformity, which replicates the diversity across small-scale societies, \u2026 e.g., the rise of \u201curban tribes\u201d.We should not proliferate categories beyond what is needed. But the story of hoe vs. plough agriculturalists shows that a simple hunter-gatherer vs. farmer narrative does not suffice. In some ways the hoe agriculturalist remains more like the hunter-gatherer, and in some ways more like his or her fellow agriculturalist. The most polygynous societies for example are arguably those of hoe based agriculturalists, as well as nomads. In contrast, hunter-gatherers and ploughman tend to be more monogamous, at least in a genetic sense.  We need to evaluate human nature and society at its true joints.

And I\u2019ll do that all in the context of a situation you should understand well: finding a shorter route to drive from home to work. (This post is ~1600 words, and so longer than usual.)Imagine that you usually take a particular route from home to work, and some firm offers to find you a better route. You tell them your current route, and they tell you that they have found a different route that will save you thirty seconds a day, which over a year adds up to eight hours. You can inspect their route to verify their claim, but only if you agree that you can\u2019t use that route (or anything close) unless you pay them a mutually agreeable fee.

Since the route is info, what they own is info. The prospect of owning that info right gives the firm an incentive to work to find that route.

{"completion": " Now imagine that you are one of hundreds of drivers who go from the same initial home area to the same final work destination. Now this route-finding firm wants to sell a better route to all of you. But there is a problem. Once this firm sells the route to a few of of you, the others may learn of that route from these few buyers, either by being told or by following their cars. In this case the total price the firm could get from all the drivers might be much less than the sum of driver values for using the better route. Thus the firm\u2019s incentive to work to find a better route could be too low. That is, this group of drivers could be better off it they joined together to paid the firm more to find a better route. But joining is too hard, so it doesn\u2019t happen.This problem is often cited as the reason governments allow patents. As an analogy, imagine there was a public website where route-finding firms could post pairs of old and new routes, so drivers easily find the new route matching their old route. The new legal rule might be that once some firm had posted such a route pair, no driver may legally use the new route matching his or her old route without paying the firm a mutually agreeable fee. This new patent-like system would restore the good incentives of the case of just one driver and one firm; an agreeable price would again lie between a firm\u2019s cost of finding the route and a driver\u2019s value of using it.At least, this new system would have good incentives if it was very easy for drivers to look up better routes on the public website, and if drivers had no better way to find faster routes, and if the legal system could accurately tell what routes drivers would have taken without the public website. To see how this could all go very wrong, consider some variations.If drivers had GPS devices to tell them about better routes, drivers might still be required to pay hundreds of dollars to route finding firms to be allowed to use routes they could have learned about for pennies from their GPS. Or, imagine these rules applied to drivers even before they moved to this city or found a job, and the system assumed that without the website such drivers would have taken a very bad route that takes twice as long. Or that drivers would have walked instead. In such cases the route-finding firms might charge drivers for the value of being able to take any reasonable route to work, rather than just the added value of their better routes.These variations would pay route-finding firms way too much. By being the first to register a route, a firm could charge drivers the value of using that route at all; the only check would be competition between firms with related routes. And if lots of route-finding firms got together to pool their routes, like firms do today with patent pools, the route-pool could charge drivers the value of being able to drive to work at all. So there\u2019d be a huge wasteful rush to register routes, after which the route-pool would basically enslave all driving workers, yet add little in the way of social value.The key problem here is that the social value of creating property rights in info comes from the value of using that created info, over and above the info such users would have had without that creation. If you instead assign them property rights in being able to use any remotely similar info, you can reward them far too much, crediting them with far more than the value they actually provide.A very similar problem happens today with software patents. If there is a library somewhere with patented algorithms for sale, the social value of a software developer using that library to achieve some purpose is the difference between the cost to search that library for an algorithm that achieves their purpose, and the cost of just making up an algorithm that achieves their purpose. Usually that difference is negative \u2013 it is usually easier to make something up than to look for prior solutions. And even when the difference is positive, that value difference is usually much less than the value of being able to achieve the purpose somehow.In most patent violation court cases, people are accused of accidentally violating a patent. In the US, patent holders can actually get triple damages if they can show that someone violated a patent on purpose. But even with that added incentive, such suits are rare. So the usual case is where someone tried to solve a problem by themselves, and the solution they hit upon just happens to be one someone else found before and patented.We have little grounds for thinking patents have much social value in such cases. After all, the developer considered looking up and buying a patented solution, and decided that it would be cheaper and easier to just make up their own solution. Yes they might have made a mistake, but they are unlikely to be systematically biased. Yes, perhaps the patent fee made all the difference; if they thought they could use a patented solution without paying its fee, maybe they\u2019d have searched for it in a library. But given the huge ranges over which relevant parameters vary, such cases must be rare.Most likely, the developer made a socially-good choice to not search. In which case, the prior discovery of the patented idea actually had no social value for this application. And even if it did have a social value, that value would often be far smaller than the value of using the rediscovered idea to solve their problem, which is the high amount patent holders usually try to charge. That high amount seems much worse than zero as an approximation to the social value the patent holder could have provided in this case.I think this gives us a great reason to excuse such developers from patent violations. That is, independently re-discovering a technique should excuse developers from using that technique without permission of the patent holder. Such re-discoverers shouldn\u2019t be able to sell the use of that technique to others, but they should be able to use it themselves. And freeing developers to use any solutions they can figure out for themselves would greatly free the software industry to more open vigorous competition, competition that patent pools now discourage.Now you might claim that even though patent holders rarely sue to get the triple damages available for intentional violations, most violations really are on purpose \u2013 such things are just much harder to prove. But at best that would justify a presumption that claimed rediscoveries are no such things unless supported by concrete data.I\u2019m told that today, developers are sometimes isolated from outside news in an attempt to avoid any accusations of intentional patent violation. But that seems pretty painful to me. \u00a0Today\u2019s surveillance society offers an easier solution.\u00a0Imagine that a developer recorded all the articles they read, the talks they hear, conversations with outside developers, and intermediate versions of software they develop. All of this might be made available for inspections during a patent violation lawsuit. If a patent holder can\u2019t find any holes in their re-discovery story after looking at all that, the story is probably true.This general approach probably works well for most non-software patents as well, but I feel less confident of that. I did software for many years, and think I at least have a good feeling for how that works.I was emboldened to write this post in part by a talk with Alex Tabarrok (who posted on it here), and by finding similar ideas endorsed by Mike Masnick here.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: September 10, 2013 2:45 pm \nTitle: Let Re-Discovery Evade Patents\nIn this post I\u2019m going to explain why patents can be a good idea, why they often go wrong today, and a way to fix that problem.

{"completion": " Alas making roughly the same future happen sooner versus later doesn\u2019t engage most people emotionally; they are much more interested in joining a \u201cfight\u201d over what character the future will take at any give size. One interesting way to take sides while still leveraging growth is to fund a long-lived organization that invests and saves its assets, and then later spends those assets to influence some side in a fight. The fact that investment rates of return have long exceeded growth rates suggests that one could achieve disproportionate influence in this way. Oddly, few seem to try this strategy.Another way to leverage growth to influence future fights is via fertility: have more kids who themselves have more kids, etc. While this is clearly a time-tested strategy, we are in an era with a puzzling disinterest in fertility, even among those who claim to seek long-term influence.Another way to join long-term fights is to add your weight to an agglomeration process whereby larger systems slowly gain over smaller ones. For example if the nations, cities, languages, and art genres with more participants tend to win over time, you can ally with one of these to help to tip the balance. Of course this influence only lasts as long as do these things. For example, if you push for short vs long hair in the current fashion change, that effect may only last until the next hair fashion cycle.Pushing for the creation of a particular world government seems an extreme example of this agglomeration effect. A world government might last a very long time, and retain features from those who influenced its source and early structure.One way to have more influence on fights is to influence systems that are plastic now but will become more rigid later. This is the logic behind persuading children while they are still ignorant and gullible, before they become ignorant and stubbornly unchanging adults. Similarly one might want to influence a young but growing firm or empire. This is also the logic behind trying to be involved in setting patterns and standards during the early days of a new technology. I remember hearing people say this explicitly back when Xanadu was trying to influence the future web. People who influenced the early structure of AM radio and FAX machines had a disproportionate influence, though such influence greatly declines when such systems themselves later decline.The farming and industrial revolutions were periods of unusual high amounts of change, and we may encounter another such revolution in a century or so. If so, it might be worth saving and collecting resources in preparation for the extra influence available during this next great revolution.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: October 31, 2018 11:30 am \nTitle: Long Legacies And Fights In An Uncaring Universe\nWhat can one do today to have a big predictable influence on the long-term future?

{"completion": " So let\u2019s turn to medical research. Every year, there are a million new medical journal articles suggesting positive benefits of specific medical treatments. That\u2019s something they didn\u2019t have in the seventeenth century. Unfortunately, we now know the medical literature to be plagued by serious biases, such as data-dredging, p-hacking, selection, attrition, and publication biases. For example, in a recent attempt to replicate 53 findings from top cancer labs, 30 papers could not be replicated due to issues like vague protocols and uncooperative authors, and less than half of the others yielded results like the original findings.But surely modern science must have some reliable way to study the aggregate value of medicine? Yes, we do. The key is to keep a study so simple, pre-announced, and well-examined that there isn\u2019t much room for authors to \u201ccheat\u201d by data-dredging, p-hacking, etc. Large trials where we randomly induce some people to consume more medicine overall, and then track how their health differs from a control population\u2013those are the key to reliable estimates. If trials are big and expensive enough, with lots of patients over many years, no one can possibly hide their results in a file drawer.Thankfully, we do have a few such studies. Yes, they have limits. They may not include all patient ages, or all kinds of medical care, and they can only see marginal health effects, of the medicine that some get that others do not. But for now, they are the best we have.Which brings us to the biggest medical news of the 2021, at least for those less inclined to give medicine the benefit of the doubt. We now have one new such study: the Karnataka hospital insurance experiment. From May 2015 to August 2018, 52,293 non-poor but otherwise typical residents of the Karnataka region of India were randomly assigned to get free hospital insurance, an option to buy such insurance, or a control condition.While the study saw large effects on hospital insurance purchases and on hospital visits, when looking at 82 health outcome changes over a five-year period the study authors \u201ccannot reject the hypothesis that the distribution of p-values from these estimates is consistent with no differences. (P=0.31)\u201d That is, they saw no net effects; people who got more medicine were not on average healthier.This result is, alas, consistent with most other high quality randomized aggregate medical experiments. For example, few health effects were seen in the 1974-1982 RAND health insurance experiment on 7700 U.S. residents over 3-5 years each, or in the 2008 Oregon Health Insurance experiment wherein 30,000 of 75,000 Oregon poor were randomly allowed to apply for Medicaid. In both studies, more health care did not translate into more health.A 2019 U.S. tax notification experiment did, maybe, see an effect. When 0.6 of 4.5 million eligible households were randomly not sent a letter warning of tax penalties, the households warned were 1.1% more likely to buy insurance, and 0.06% less likely to die, over the next two years. Now that last death result was only significant at the 1% level, which is marginal. So there\u2019s a decent chance this study is just noise.Bottom line: we spend 20% of G.D.P. on medicine, most people credit it for their long lives, and millions of medical journal articles seem to confirm its enormous value. Yet our lives are long for other reasons, those articles often show huge biases, and when we look to our few best aggregate studies to assuage our doubts, they do no such thing. And the biggest news of 2021 is: we now have one more such study.It seems we have three options: we can stick our head in the sand and ignore this unwelcome news, we can accept the difficult truth that medicine just isn\u2019t that useful, or we can hope there\u2019s some mistake here and check again. A mere 0.1% of U.S. annual medical spending, or $4.2 billion, could fund a far larger experiment, and hopefully settle the matter.

{"completion": " Here\u2019s my idea: nickname courts. Imagine that people are tempted to use a nickname for a certain person in a particular social context. Such as: the 2nd grade homeroom 3 of public school 117 wants to use the nickname \u201cStinky Stu\u201d for young member Steward Williams. Perhaps on the basis of recent events wherein young Stu was said to be stinky.Assume there\u2019s no law against using such a nickname, but that students, parents, and teachers might feel there are relevant social norms against doing something so \u201crude\u201d. Some of these authorities might even declare their own local rules regulating such nicknames. (Nicknames are going to exist no matter what rules; the best we can do is to better channel that instinct.) I propose that these authorities give substantial deference to a new kind of court, a nickname court.Someone initiates the process by officially proposing a nickname for a person in a social context, and committing to argue in its favor. That person who is to be given this nickname is notified, and confirms that they will oppose this. Then a \u201crandom\u201d jury drawn from this social context is impaneled, which in the example above would be members of this homeroom class. They come together, all present their arguments and evidence, and the jury decides. In the example above, these might all be 2nd grade members of this class, including Stu.If the jury rules yes, then it becomes more acceptable for members of this community to use this nickname of Stinky Stu for this particular Stu. This ruling may or may not have any legal force, even within the official rules of the school. But people might feel more comfortable knowing that their actions had this \u201cofficial\u201d support.If Stu later decided that things had changed enough, he might initiate a new case, arguing that the nickname should no longer apply. Others would be notified, and we\u2019d see if anyone wanted to take the lead to oppose him, starting with whomever initiated that first case. If Stu wins, then it would no longer to be as acceptable to call him Stinky Stu, though it might be okay to call him, \u201cOnce-was Stinky Stu\u201d.This sort of approach could obviously be applied to social media. For example, someone might initiate a case to make it more okay to call Robert Random by the nickname \u201cRacist Rob\u201d on Twitter. As I\u2019ve said before, many of us might prefer a formal process for such labels over the current internet mobs that greatly suffer from rushes to judgment.I\u2019d bet that kids could really get into nickname courts, and learn a lot about law in the process. And later in life they\u2019d probably think more about how similar processes might apply to other topics. For example, I\u2019d love to have Radical Reform Courts, which evaluate radical proposals for social reform. Today there\u2019s way too much of a rush to judgement, wherein each person who hears of a proposal quickly imagines one potential problem, and then concludes that it can\u2019t work.

{"completion": " Since the economy mainly grows today via innovation, our ladder of growth is basically a ladder of overall innovation. We only double the economy when we have on averaged doubled our abilities across all economic sectors. So if the relative rates of economic growth and innovation in different sectors stay the same, then speeding up economic growth means speeding up the rate of progress toward full UAI. (While some expect\u00a0a larger economy to\u00a0innovate faster because it has more resources, the steady economic growth rates we\u2019ve seen suggest there are contrary forces, such as picking the low hanging fruit of research first.)For example, at past rates of UAI progress it should take two to four centuries to reach human level abilities in the typical UAI subfield, and thus even longer in most subfields. Since the world economy now doubles roughly every fifteen years, that comes to twenty doublings in three centuries. If ems show up halfway from now to\u00a0full human level usual AI, there\u2019d still be ten economic doublings to go, which would then take ten months if the economy doubled monthly. Which is definitely faster UAI progress.However, ten doublings of the economy can encompass a whole era worthy of study. I\u2019ve argued that ems would typically\u00a0run fast enough to fit a subjective career of a century or more within an economic doubling time, so that their early career training can remain relevant over a whole career. So ten doublings is at least ten subjective centuries, which is plenty of time for lots of cultural and social change. A whole age of change, in fact.Some argue that the existence of ems would speed up innovation in general, because ems are smarter and innovation benefits more from smarts than does typical production. But even if true, this doesn\u2019t change the relative rate of innovation in UAI relative to other areas.Some argue that ems speed up UAI progress in particular, via being able to inspect brain circuits in detail and experiment with variations. But as it can be very hard to learn how to code just from inspecting object spaghetti code from other coders, I\u2019m skeptical that this effect could speed up progress anything like a factor of two, which would be where\u00a0two (logarithmic) steps on the\u00a0UAI\u00a0ladder of progress are now jumped when single steps are on average jumped\u00a0elsewhere. And even then there\u2019d still be at least five economic doublings in the em era, giving at least five subjective centuries of cultural change.And we know of substantial\u00a0contrary effects. First, UAI progress seems driven in part by computer hardware progress, which looks like it will be slower in the coming decades than it has in past decades, relative to other areas of innovation. More important,\u00a0a big part of em era growth can be due to raw physical growth in production, via making many more ems. If half of em economic growth is due to this process then the em economy makes two (logarithmic) steps of economic growth for every step on the ladder of innovation progress, turning ten ladder steps into twenty doublings. A long age of em.Some argue that the availability of ems will greatly speed the rate of UAI innovation relative to other rates of innovation. They say things like:When ems are cheap, you could have a million top (e.g., 100 times average) quality UAI research ems each running at a million times human speed. Since until now we\u2019ve only had a thousand average quality UAI researchers at any one time, UAI progress could be a hundred billion times faster, making what would have taken three centuries now take a tenth of a second. The prize of getting to full UAI first would\u00a0induce this investment.There are just so many things wrong with this statement.First, even if human speed ems are cheap, mega-ems cost at least a million times as much. A million mega-ems are as productive as trillion humans, times whatever factor by which the typical human-speed em is more productive than a typical human. The em economy would have to have grown a whole lot before it is\u00a0even possible to devote that level of resources to UAI research. So there can be a whole em era before that point.Second, this same approach seems equally able to speed up progress in any innovation area that isn\u2019t strongly limited by physical process rates. Areas that only moderately depend on physical rates can spend more to compensate, so that\u00a0their innovation rates slow only modestly. If only a modest fraction of innovation areas were substantially limited by physical rates, that would only speed up UAI progress by a modest factor relative to overall economic growth.Third, just because some researchers publish many more academic papers than others doesn\u2019t at all mean that young copies of those researchers assigned to other research areas would have published similarly. Ex ante expected researcher quality varies a lot less than ex post observed research publications. Yes, people often vary by larger factors in their ability to do pure math, relative to other abilities, but pure math contributes only a small fraction to overall innovation.Fourth, it is well known that most innovation doesn\u2019t come from formal research, and that innovations in different areas help each other. Economists have strong general reasons to expect diminishing returns to useful innovation from adding more researchers. Yes, if you double the number of researchers in one area you\u2019ll probably get twice as many research papers in that area, but that is very different from twice as getting much useful progress.As I mention in my book, in some cases we\u2019ve actually measured how research progress varies with the number of researchers, and it looks more like a square root dependence. In addition, if innovation rates were linear in the number of formal researchers, then given the tiny fraction of such researchers today we\u2019d have to be vastly underinvesting in them, and so nations who invest more in formal research should expect to see much higher rates of economic growth. Yet we don\u2019t actually see much of a relation between economic growth and spending on formal research. (Yes studies vary, so there could\u00a0be a modest, but not a huge, effect.)So, in sum, we should expect that useful UAI innovation doesn\u2019t mostly come from formal research, and so doubling the number of UAI researchers, or doubling their speed, doesn\u2019t remotely double useful innovation. We aren\u2019t vastly underinvesting in formal research, and so future parties\u00a0can\u2019t expect to achieve huge gains by making a huge new investment there. We can expect to see modest gain in UAI innovation, relative to today and to other innovation areas, from an ability to inspect and experiment with ems, and from not being very limited by physical process rates. But these give less than a factor of two, and we should see a factor of two in the other direction from slowing hardware gains and from innovation mattering less for economic growth.Thus we should expect many doublings of the em era after ems and before human level UAI, resulting in many centuries of subjective cultural change for typical ems. Giving an em era that is long enough to be worth considering. If you want to study whatever comes after the em era, understanding the em era should help.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: August 2, 2016 12:40 pm \nTitle: No Short Em Age\nThe basic premise of my book is that the next big revolution on the scale of the farming and industrial revolutions will come from human level artificial intelligence in the form of brain emulations (ems).

Use slaves as rowers, and have a boss watch them, whipping any who\u00a0aren\u2019t rowing as hard as sustainably possible. This actually didn\u2019t happen much in the ancient world; galley slaves weren\u2019t common until the 1500s. But the idea is simple. And of course the same system could also work with cash; usually make positive payments for work, but sometimes fine those\u00a0you discover\u00a0aren\u2019t working hard enough.

Why bother to work hard, if it makes little\u00a0difference to your chance of reward or punishment?There is a general principle here. As we add more noise to the measurement of relevant outcomes visible to the ultimate boss, the harder it is to use incentives tied to such outcomes to incentivize rowers.

{"completion": " Yes, one can create layers of bosses, with the lowest\u00a0bosses able to see specifics best. But it can be hard to give lower\u00a0bosses good incentives, if higher bosses can\u2019t see well.Another problem is if the boss doesn\u2019t know just how hard each oarsman is capable of rowing. In this case most oarsmen get some slack, so that they aren\u2019t punished for not doing\u00a0more than they can. This is just one example of an \u201cinformation rent\u201d. In general, such rents come from any work-relevant info that the worker has that the boss can\u2019t see. If rowers need to synchronize their actions with each other or with waves or wind or time of day. If a\u00a0ship captain needs to choose the ship\u2019s route based info on weather and pirates. If a captain needs to treat different cargo differently in different conditions. If a\u00a0captain need to make judgements about whether to wait longer in port for more cargo.In general, when you want a worker to see some local condition, and then take an action that depends on that condition, you must pay some extra rent. So the more relevant info that workers get, the more choices they make, and the more that rides on those choices, the more workers gain in info rents.A related issue is the scope for sabotage. Angry resentful workers can seek hidden ways to hurt their bosses and ventures. So the more hard-to-detect ways workers have to hurt things, the more bosses\u00a0want to treat them well enough to avoid anger and resentment. Pained, sullen, or depressed workers can also hurt the mood of co-workers, suppliers, customers, and investors whom they contact. And the threat of pain can stress workers, making it harder for them to think clearly and well. These issues tend to argue against often using beatings and pain for motivation, even if such things allow stronger incentives by expanding the range of possible outcomes.Overall, these issues are bigger for more \u201ccomplex\u201d work, i.e., for more cognitive work, work that adapts more to diverse and new local conditions, and work in larger organizations. In the modern world, jobs have been getting more complex in these ways, and the organization and work literature I\u2019ve read suggests that finding good work incentives is a central problem in modern organizations, and that more complex work is a big reason why modern workplaces substitute broad incentives and good treatment for the detailed and harsh rules and monitoring more common in past eras.The literature I\u2019ve read on the economics of slavery also uses job complexity to explain the severity of treatment of slaves. Slaves in artisan jobs, in cities, and in households were treated better than field slaves, arguably because of job complexity. They were beaten less, and paid more, and might eventually buy their own freedom.Bryan Caplan has argued that ems would be treated harshly as slaves:Why wouldn\u2019t ems\u2019 creators use the threat of `physical hunger, exhaustion, pain, sickness, grime, hard labor, or sudden unexpected death\u2019 to motivate the ems? Robin elsewhere talks about `torturing\u2019 ems, so why not?\u201d .. Modern systems of slave labor \u2013 see Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany \u2013 used pain freely, because the penalty for quitting was death. (more)When slave-owners have imperfect information about slaves\u2019 productivity, high quotas lead to lots of counter-productive punishments. Threatening to execute everyone who falls below the 90th-percentile of output, for example, requires slave-owners to kill 90% of their slaves. Information about ems\u2019 productivity, however, should be much more accurate, especially since most descend from a small number of exceptional humans. These are ideal conditions for heavy use of negative incentives. (more)3. Moral and legal barriers aside, imperfect information about workers\u2019 ability is the only self-interested reason not to treat them as slaves, especially when you can pre-select workers for docile personalities.4. Since brain scans allow for cheap copying, employers would have excellent information about ems\u2019 true abilities. Create a few dozen copies, give them life-or-death incentives to excel, and see what they accomplish. Then use that information against all the copies: Perform at your potential or we\u2019ll inflict horrible pain on you. (more)Caplan sees one particular kind of info rent falling with ems. And yes, with large em clans bosses would know more about the permanent general tendencies of ems. But individual ems would still differ due to different training and work experience. And more important, most info rents in modern complex jobs don\u2019t come from info about permanent general tendencies! Even if you know a worker in great detail, you\u2019ll still need to give them good incentives to react well to specific job context, and you\u2019ll need to treat them well enough to avoid motivating hidden sabotage.Most of Caplan\u2019s disagreement with my book comes from his thinking\u00a0ems are extremely docile. So extreme that (as I summarized):Ems are not disturbed by \u201clife events\u201d, only by disappointing their masters. They only group, identify, and organize as commanded, not as they prefer or choose. They have no personality \u201cin a human sense.\u201d They never disagree with each other, and never need to make excuses for anything.Yet the following is the only argument he\u2019s given:Only a tiny hand-picked sub-sample of humans will be copied. The obvious question: Why wouldn\u2019t ems largely be copies of the most \u201crobot-like\u201d humans \u2013 humble workaholics with minimal personal life, content to selflessly and uncomplainingly serve their employers? (more)Today workers who are taller have some advantages, like being able to reach taller shelves. But shorter workers also have advantages, like crawling in smaller tunnels. You can\u2019t just look at one advantage of one feature and conclude that a feature is an advantage overall; you have to look at the net effect of that feature. Yes there are some advantages of\u00a0employees who don\u2019t talk back and never question orders. But there are obviously disadvantages as well. Sometimes you want workers to be creative, take the initiative, and to persuade and inspire others, and \u201crobot-like\u201d hardly seems best for these.I\u2019ve tried to look for data on overall effects:Our best data should be the most productive people in the world today, or that we\u2019ve seen in history. Yet the most productive people I know are not remotely \u201crobot-like\u201d, at least in the sense he describes above. Can Caplan name any specific workers, or groups, he knows that fit the bill? In writing the book I searched for literatures on work productivity, and used many dozens of articles on specific productivity correlates. But I never came across anything remotely claiming \u201crobot-like\u201d workers (or tortured slaves) to be the most productive in modern jobs. (more)I didn\u2019t find any data on slaves and docility, though I did find how docility fits into the standard five factor personality framework. Docility is lumped with \u201csubmissive, dependent, pliant\u201d as part of \u201cpassivity\u201d, which correlates most strongly and positively with neuroticism, but also positively with agreeableness and negatively with openness. In general only the agreeable part suggests more productivity in most jobs today; neurotic people are less productive, and the effect of openness depends more on job type.

{"completion": " Imagine that you have a proposal for a better policy, to be used by governments, businesses, or other organizations. How can you get people to listen to your proposal, and perhaps endorse it or apply it? You might try to use personal connections to get an audience with someone at a government agency, political interest group, think tank, foundation, or business. But that\u2019s stuck in the private connection world. You might wait for an agency or foundation to put out an open call for proposals, seeking a solution to exactly the problem your proposal solves. But for any one proposal idea, you might wait a very long time.You might submit an article to an open conference or journal, or submit a book to a publisher. But if they accept your submission, that mostly won\u2019t be an endorsement of whether your proposal is good policy by some metric. Publishers are mostly looking at other criteria, such as whether you have an impressive study using difficult methods, or whether you have a book thesis and writing style that will attract many readers.So I propose that we consider creating an open process for submitting policy proposals to be evaluated, in the hope of gaining some level of endorsement and perhaps further action. This process won\u2019t judge your submission on wit, popularity, impressiveness, or analytical rigor. Their key question is: is this promising as a policy proposal to actually adopt, for the purpose of making a better world? If they endorse your proposal, then other actors can use that as a quality signal regarding what policy proposals to consider.Of course how you judge a policy proposal depends on your values. So there might be different open policy evaluators (OPE) based on different sets of values. Each OPE needs to have some consistent standards by which they evaluate proposals. For example, economists might ask whether a proposal improves economic efficiency, libertarians might ask if it increases liberty, and progressives might ask whether it reduces inequality.Should the evaluation of a proposal consider whether there\u2019s a snowball chance in hell of a proposal being actually adopted, or even officially considered? That is, whether it is in the \u201cOverton window\u201d? Should they consider whether you have so far gained sufficient celebrity endorsements to make people pay attention to your proposal? Well, those are choices of evaluation criteria. I\u2019m personally more interested in evaluating proposals regardless of who has supported them, and regardless of their near-term political feasibility. Like how academics say we do today with journal article submissions. But that\u2019s just me.An OPE seems valid and useful as long as its actual choices of which policies it endorses match its declared evaluation criteria. Then it can serve as a useful filter, between people with innovative policy ideas and policy customers seeking useful ideas to consider and perhaps implement. If you can find OPEs who share your evaluation criteria, you can consider the policies they endorse. And of course if we ever end up having many of them, you could focus first on the most prestigious ones.Ideally an OPE would have funding from some source to pay for its evaluations. But I could also imagine applicants having to pay a fee to have their proposals considered.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: November 27, 2018 8:15 pm \nTitle: Open Policy Evaluation\nHypocrisy is a tribute vice pays to virtue.

{"completion": " There is a final point that is much trickier: political inclinations and other non-epistemic factors color our social-scientific judgments, for experts as well as for novices. \u2026 When deciding where to place that trust, we rely on a number of factors, mostly involving the track record of the group to which the purported expert belongs, if not the individual experts themselves. So my advice to economists who want more respect from the outside world would be: make it much more clear to the non-expert public that you have a reliable, agreed-upon set of non-obvious discoveries that your field has made about the world. People have tried to lay out such discoveries, of course \u2014 but upon closer inspection they don\u2019t quite measure up to Newton\u2019s Laws in terms of reliability and usefulness.The public is taught to credit physicists for all those physical things around them they enjoy, like cars, planes, phones, and skyscrapers. The public is not taught to credit economists for all those great economic institutions around them like markets, firms, cities, and industries. So naturally physicists are seen as contributing more. But is this fair?Yes, economists were only a supporting influence in creating all those great economic institutions, unless we want to define all businessmen as economists. But similarly, physicists were only a supporting influence in creating all those great physical devices, unless we want to define all engineers as physicists. There were useful steam engines long before thermodynamics helped explain them, and it took far more than basic physics to get men to the moon, just as it took far more than basic economics to create modern industries. It is actually quite hard to say which discipline has been more useful overall to the world.They key difference, I think, is that more interested parties see themselves as losing if the public listens to economists, and these parties therefore dispute economists in public. Such interested parties also influence individual economists, and so weaken within-economics consensus. In contrast, few care enough about what physicists say to dispute them in public.The fact that economists are more disputed in public than physicists seem plenty sufficient to explain the differing public treatment of the two fields. Even if physicists did have a more \u201creliable, agreed-upon set of non-obvious discoveries,\u201d that couldn\u2019t explain the differing public treatment of the two fields for the simple reason that the vast majority of the public has no idea about such things. They don\u2019t know about physical or economic discoveries, nor about how reliable or useful such things are. What the public mainly knows is that when physicists talk few disagree, but when economists talk lots of folks disagree, and each ordinary Joe is himself often tempted to disagree.Now the fact that economists are more disputed does in fact give the public more reason to doubt what economists say. But this only justifies increased uncertainty, not swapping expert opinion for their own personal reasoning. The desire to believe that what is in your interest is also in the general interest can on average distort individual reasoning just as much as it can expert reasoning, if not more so. In both fields it is better to believe nothing, or believe the experts.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: September 13, 2011 11:30 pm \nTitle: Physics vs. Economics\nAt my prodding, Sean Carrol considered the differing public treatment of physicists and economists:In the public imagination, natural scientists have figured out a lot more reliable and non-obvious things about the world, compared to what non-experts would guess, than social scientists have.

The lifetime value of the lost citations is roughly in the range of $13,000 to $19,000.

Which matters because remote work (a.k.a. telecommuting) is my guess for the most important neglected trend over the next 30 years.

In contrast, these discussions get closer to the truth:If rural residents can enjoy the agglomeration benefits of urban life without moving to the city, prosperity can be more widely shared.

{"completion": " If people everywhere can enjoy the benefits of agglomeration without the need to physically cluster together there will no longer be a need to flee the country for the city. If we succeed, not only will we bring rural economies into the virtuous cycle of agglomeration benefits, but we may even accelerate innovation and growth by connecting up the entire country into one digital city.This is hardly a new idea. At the dawn of the internet era, it was conventional wisdom that the world was flat and the internet would spell the death of distance. It didn\u2019t happen. \u2026 So what went wrong? I think we all made the classic mistake of underestimating how long it would take for us to figure out how to effectively use a new general purpose technology. \u2026 It may yet turn out that the death of distance is right, but was just ahead of its time. (More)To see the potential, consider plumbing. Today plumbers are generalists who work for small scale firms. Each plumber does most plumbing tasks, and you usually pick one from among a few small local firms. Now imagine that a plumbing avatar can be controlled well remotely by plumbers a thousand miles away. An avatar comes to do your plumbing job, an avatar controlled in sequence by plumbers who specialize in doing each stage of your type of plumbing problem. Just as factories can be more efficient when each worker specializes in doing one small task, plumbing could also become more efficient via such specialization. And each plumbing specialist could be chosen as the best from all candidates within a thousand miles.Today bigger cities are more efficient mainly because, via agglomeration, they create larger markets with more/better specialization:A larger market allows for a more efficient sharing of local infrastructure, a variety of intermediate input suppliers, or a pool of workers. \u2026 better matching between employers and employees, or buyers and suppliers. \u2026 facilitate learning, by facilitating the transmission and accumulation of skills or by promoting the development and adoption of new technologies and business practices. (More)With sufficiently advanced remote work capabilities, each worker in a large region could compete for any job in that region, without having to move their home. So whole big regions, continents or even the whole planet could function like single huge cities, with matching levels of work specialization, at least for tasks that can be done remotely. As a result, tasks that workers do remotely in such regions could become very specialized, in part via larger more complicated firms and work task coordination. Many small fragmented labor markets would merge into a few large integrated labor markets.Of course, we are a long way away from this situation now, and the path to get there is harder than futurists anticipated decades ago. But this pandemic has given us a big push, and in thirty years I think we will have gone far enough that at least one quarter of human work will be done remotely.Progress here will require us to overcome many obstacles.\u00a0Many decades ago, remote work was limited mostly by insufficient bandwidth and latency, but these limits are receding. Limits are now more about coordination and innovation. We must find new ways to achieve subtle social job tasks that previously relied on close and flexible physical contact, and we must reorganize which tasks go into which jobs so as to create more remote jobs that only rarely need close physical contact. But pandemic distancing policies are pushing us to work much harder to achieve these changes.Larger more integrated remote-work labor markets will seek to standardize on work hours, skills, habits, and rules, to let workers from wider regions compete for each remote job. Work hours may be why the whole world doesn\u2019t become one integrated labor market. Local variations in language, education, and regulations may become obstacles, rewarding the places that can most standardize these things. Larger firms will form to support more job specialization and coordination, though local regulations may also block such firms. (Similar problems would appear today if different parts of cities had sufficiently different regulations.) \u00a0This might create a push for more global regulation.In many and even most jobs, no doubt for a long time the extra productivity gains allowed by direct physical contact will beat the gains from larger more integrated labor markets, even considering the costs of commuting and living close enough to work directly together. Especially considering that many workers will dislike remote work, all else equal, and many will want to live close to large urban concentrations for non-work reasons. But note that during the industrial era work methods with large productivity gains have tended to win out in the long run, even when workers don\u2019t enjoy them as much.Eventually, when a large fraction of office jobs have gone remote, limits will turn to the quality of avatar tele-robots and control haptics, and to finding sufficiently low latency comm. (Bandwidth will probably be plenty big by then.) As those limits get pushed back, a great many ordinary physical jobs can be done remotely. At first shop clerks, receptionists, and inspectors, and later drivers, janitors, plumbers, and even hairdressers.Note that remote workers will be more willing to move their home for social, weather, political, and other reasons, as their job doesn\u2019t tie them to their location.Note also that by recording remote work tasks one can create big datasets of how jobs are done, to allow machine learning of those tasks. This will help to automate them, but still my bet is that automation progress will continue to be slow.\u00a0In addition, a world in which most jobs are done remotely is a world in which ems can more easily replace human workers. No need to work hard to design human-like bodies for ems if remote-worker avatars are already sufficient to do most human jobs.Interestingly, a vision of larger scale more integrated labor markers already exists in the concept of a \u201cglobal workforce\u201d. Which many see as a terrible thing:Global workforce refers to the international labor pool of workers \u2026 ImplicationsSocial vulnerability \u2026 A high [non-worker to worker] dependency ratio can cause serious problems for a country if a large proportion of a government\u2019s expenditure is on health, social security & education, \u2026Downward pressure on wages \u2026 new entrants to the global workforce since the 1980s brought little capital with them, \u2026 cut the global capital-labor ratio to around 55\u201360% of what it otherwise would have been.\u2026 could mean \u2026 downward pressure on wages and compensation, particularly in more advanced economiesRace to the bottom \u2026 companies searching for the lowest-cost \u2026 lowest-cost labor is often found in countries that have the fewest protections for workers. \u2026 exploitation and even death of workers in countries that have the fewest protections. \u2026 pressure to lower domestic and, ultimately, international labor standards.Mitigating factors \u2026 growing number of multinationals, especially from wealthier areas, are starting to see the benefits of keeping more of their operations close to home. (more)Yet by this same logic we should lament large cities today, and prefer folks to live in small villages with town governments powerful enough to prevent local labor market competition. Like, say, feudal manors of medieval Europe. But if we celebrate our largest cities, and want other areas to be more like them, then by the same logic we should favor the larger more integrate labor markets that remote work could bring.Added 10a: Adam Ozimek points me to his recent report:In a sense, remote work will allow the creation of a massive online labor market that is subject to many of the same forces of agglomeration that cities experience. \u2026 A remote labor market that was just over 6% of the labor force would be bigger than any city in the country.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: August 8, 2020 9:30 pm \nTitle: Remote Work Specializes\nWe seem on track to spend far more preventing pandemic health harm than we will suffer from it, which seems too much spending given the apparent low elasticity of harm w.r.t. prevention.

{"completion": " My book with Kevin Simler describes many hidden human motives, common in our everyday lives. But that raises the question: how exactly can we humans hide our motives from ourselves?Consider that we humans are constantly watching and testing our and others\u2019 words and deeds for inconsistency, incoherence, and hypocrisy. As our rivals are eager to point out such flaws, we each try to adjust our words and deeds to cut and smooth the flaws we notice. Furthermore, we habitually adjust our words and deeds to match those of our associates, to make remaining flaws be shared flaws. After a lifetime of such smoothing, how could much personal incoherence remain?One way to keep motives hidden is to hide your most questionable actions, those where you feel you least control or understand them. If you can\u2019t hide such actions, then try not to make strong claims about related motives. And I think we do follow this strategy for our strongest feelings, such as lust, envy, or social anxiety. We often try to hide such feelings even from ourselves, and when we do notice them we often fall silent; we fear to speak on them.How easy it is to check deeds and words for coherence depends in part on how dense and clear are their connections. And as all deeds are concrete, and as concrete words tend to be clearer and more densely connected, it seems easier to check concrete priorities, relative to abstract ones.For example, it is easiest to check the motives that lead to our conscious, often written, calculations of detailed plans. Our time schedules, spatial routes and layouts, and our spending habits are often visible and full of details that make it hard to hide priorities.

And when we are all in denial in similar ways on similar topics, then we can all be reluctant to \u201cthrow stones\u201d at our shared \u201cglass houses\u201d. This seems to apply to our hidden motives re schools and medicine, for example; we apparently all want to pretend together that school is for learning job skills and hospitals are for raising health.Compared to our concrete priorities, our abstract priority expressions (e.g, \u201cfamily is everything\u201d) are less precise, and so are harder to check against each other for consistency. And abstract expressions can be even harder to check against concrete actions; large datasets of deeds may be required to check for such coherence.We ground most abstract concepts, like \u201cfire\u201d, \u201csky\u201d, \u201ckid\u201d or \u201csleep\u201d, by reference to concrete examples with which we have had direct experience. So when we are confused about their usage, we can turn to those examples to get clear. But we ground other more \u201csacred\u201d abstract concepts, like \u201clove\u201d, \u201cjustice\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d, more by reference to other abstract concepts. These are more like \u201cfloating abstractions.\u201d And this habit makes it even harder to check our uses of such sacred concepts for coherence.This potential of abstract concepts to allow more evasion of coherence checking is greatly enhanced by the fact that our brains have two rather different systems for thinking. First, our \u201cnear\u201d system is designed to look at important-to-us close-up things, by attending to their details. This system is better integrated with our conscious thoughts. For example, we often first do a kind of calculation slowly and consciously, and then later by habit we learn to do such calculations unconsciously. This integration supports coherence checking, as we can respond to explicit challenges by temporarily returning to conscious calculation, to find explanations for our choices.Our \u201cfar\u201d system, in contrast, is designed to look at less-important-to-us far-away things, about which we usually know only a few more abstract descriptors. This system uses many opaque quick and dirty heuristics, including intuitive emotional and aesthetic associations, crude correlations, naive trust, and social approval. If someone else is using this system in their head to think about a topic, and then you use this system in your head to try to check their thinking, you will have a hard time judging much more than if your system gives the same answers as theirs. If you get different answers, it will be hard to say exactly why.As our minds tend to invoke our far systems for thinking about more abstract topics, that makes it even harder to check abstract thoughts for coherence. But, you might respond, if that system is designed for dealing with relatively unimportant things, won\u2019t the other near system get invoked for important topics, limiting this problem of being harder to check coherence to unimportant topics?Alas, no, due to the sacred. Our sacred things are our especially important things, described via floating abstractions, where our norm is to think about them only using our far systems. We are not to calculate them, consider their details, or mix them with or trade them off against other things. Our intuitions there are sacred, and beyond question.Making it hard to check the coherence of related deeds and words. The main thing we can do there is to intuit our own answer and compare it to others\u2019 answers. If we get the same answers, that confirms that they share our sense of the sacred, and are from our in-group. If not, we can conclude they are from an out-group, and thus suspect; they didn\u2019t learn the \u201cright\u201d sense of the sacred.And that\u2019s some of the ways that our minds tend to hide our motives, even given the widespread practice of trying to expose incoherence in rivals\u2019 words and deeds. Floating abstractions help, and the sacred helps even more. And maybe we go further and coordinate to punish those who try to expose our sacred hypocrites.Note that I\u2019m not claiming that all these habits and structures were designed primarily for this effect of making it harder to check our words and deeds for coherence. I\u2019m mainly pointing out that they have this effect.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: September 7, 2022 10:32 am \nTitle: Sacred Distance Hides Motives\nMy book with Kevin Simler describes many hidden human motives, common in our everyday lives. But that raises the question: how exactly can we humans hide our motives from ourselves?Consider that we humans are constantly watching and testing our and others\u2019 words and deeds for inconsistency, incoherence, and hypocrisy. As our rivals are eager to point out such flaws, we each try to adjust our words and deeds to cut and smooth the flaws we notice. Furthermore, we habitually adjust our words and deeds to match those of our associates, to make remaining flaws be shared flaws. After a lifetime of such smoothing, how could much personal incoherence remain?One way to keep motives hidden is to hide your most questionable actions, those where you feel you least control or understand them. If you can\u2019t hide such actions, then try not to make strong claims about related motives. And I think we do follow this strategy for our strongest feelings, such as lust, envy, or social anxiety. We often try to hide such feelings even from ourselves, and when we do notice them we often fall silent; we fear to speak on them.How easy it is to check deeds and words for coherence depends in part on how dense and clear are their connections. And as all deeds are concrete, and as concrete words tend to be clearer and more densely connected, it seems easier to check concrete priorities, relative to abstract ones.For example, it is easiest to check the motives that lead to our conscious, often written, calculations of detailed plans. Our time schedules, spatial routes and layouts, and our spending habits are often visible and full of details that make it hard to hide priorities. For example, if you go out of your way to drive past the home of your ex \u00a0on your way home from work, it will be hard to pretend you don\u2019t care about her.\n\n###\n\n"}

{"completion": " Given a substantial chance (1% will do) that a work might be evaluated by historians in a century or two, we could then create (conditional) prediction markets now estimating those future evaluations. So a customer might pay their $20 now, and get an immediate prediction market estimate of that future evaluation for their work. That $20 might pay $10 for the (chance of a) future evaluation and another $10 to establish and subsidize a prediction market over the coming centuries until resolution.Finally, if customers thought market estimate regarding their works looked too low, then they could of course try to bet to raise those estimates. Skeptics would no doubt lie waiting to bet against them, and on average this tendency of authors to bet to support their works would probably subsidize these markets, and so lower the fees that the system needs to charge.Of course even with big budgets for evaluations, if we want future historians to make reliable enough formal estimates that we can bet on in advance, then we will need to give them a well-defined-enough task to accomplish. And we need to define this task in a way that discourages future historians from expressing their gratitude to all these people who funded their work by giving them all an A+.I suggest we have future historians estimate each work\u2019s\u00a0ideal attention: how much attention each particular work should have been given during some time period. So we should pick some measure of attention, a measure that we can calculate for works when they are submitted, and track over time. This measure should weigh if the dissertation was approved, the paper was published and where, how many cites did it get, etc. If we add up all the initial attention for submitted works, then we can assign historians the task of (counterfactually) reallocating this total attention across all the submitted works. So to give more attention to some, they\u2019d have to take away attention from others.Okay, so now they can\u2019t give every work an A+. (And we ensure that bet assets have bounded values.) But our job isn\u2019t done. We also need to give them a principle to follow when allocating attention among all these prior works. What objective would they be trying to accomplish via this reallocation of attention?I suggest that the objective just be intellectual progress, toward the world having access to more accurate and useful beliefs. A set of works should have gotten more attention if in that case the world would have been more likely to have more quickly come to appreciate valuable truths. And this task is probably easier if we ask future historians to use their future values in this task, instead of asking them to try to judge according to our values today.These evaluation tasks probably get easier if historians randomly pick related sets of works to evaluate together, instead of independently picking each work to evaluate. And this system can probably offer scaled fees, wherein the chance that your work gets evaluated rises linearly with the price you paid for that chance. There are probably a lot more details to work out, but I expect I\u2019ve already said enough for most people to decide roughly how much they like this idea.Once there were many works in this system, and many prediction markets estimating their shoulda-been attention, then we could look to see if market speculators see any overall biases in today\u2019s intellectual worlds. That is, topics, methods, disciplines, genders, etc. to which speculators estimate that the world today is giving too little attention. That could be pretty dramatic and damning evidence of bias, by someone, evidence to which we\u2019d all be wise to attend.One obvious test of this approach would be to assign historians today the task of reallocating attention among papers published a century or two ago. Perhaps assign multiple independent groups, and see how correlated are their evaluations, and how that correlation varies across topic areas. Perhaps repeating in a decade or two, to see how much evaluations drift over time.Showing these correlations to potential customers might convince them that there\u2019s a good enough chance that such a system will later correctly vindicate their neglected contributions. And these tests may show good scopes to use, for related works and time periods to evaluate together, and how narrow or broad should be the expertise of the evaluators.This whole shoulda-listened-futures approach could or course also be applied to many other kinds of works, not just intellectual works. You\u2019d just have to establish your standards for how future historians are to allocate shoulda attention, and trust them to actually follow those standards. Doing tests on works from centuries ago here could also help to show if this is a viable approach for these kinds of works.Added 7am 28Apr: On average more assets will be available to pay for future evaluations if the fees paid are invested in risky assets. So instead of promising a particular percentage chance of evaluation, it may make more sense to specify how fees will be invested, set the (real) amount to be spent on each evaluation, and then promise that the chance of evaluation for each work will be set by the investment return relative to the initial fee paid. Yes that induces more evaluations in state of the world where investments do better, but customers are already accepting a big chance that their work will never be directly evaluated.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: April 27, 2021 6:45 pm \nTitle: Shoulda-Listened Futures\nOver the decades I have written many times on how prediction markets might help the intellectual world.

On generic coordination gains, Shulman points to war:Consider a contest \u2026 such that a preemptive strike would completely destroy the other power, although retaliatory action would destroy 90% of the inhabitants of the aggressor. For the self-concerned individuals, this would be a disaster \u2026 But for the superorganisms \u2026 [this] would be no worse than the normal deletion and replacement of everyday affairs.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: October 4, 2011 9:45 pm \nTitle: Shulman On Superorgs\n\n###\n\n"}
{"completion": " On the generic costs of value sharing, I think Shulman\u2019s intuition is that a mind\u2019s values can be expressed in a relatively small static file. While it might be expensive to figure out what actions achieve any particular set of values, the cost to simply store a values file can be tiny for a large mind. And Shulman can\u2019t see see why using the same small file in different parts of a large system would cost more to implement that using different small files.Shulman\u2019s concrete argument outlines ways for ems to share values:Superorganisms [are] groups of related emulations ready to individually sacrifice themselves in pursuit of the shared aims of the superorganism. \u2026 To produce emulations with trusted motivations, \u2026 copies could be subjected to exhaustive psychological testing, staged situations, and direct observation of their emulation software to form clear pictures of their loyalties. \u2026 Members of a superorganism could consent to deletion after a limited time to preempt any such value divergence. \u2026 After a short period of work, each copy would be replaced by a fresh copy of the same saved state, preventing ideological drift.Shulman also suggests concrete em coordination gains:Many of the productivity advantages stem from the ability to copy and delete emulations freely, without objections from the individual emulations being deleted. \u2026 Emulations could have their state saved to storage regularly, so that the state of peak productivity could be identified. \u2026 whenever a short task arises, a copy of the peak state emulation could be made to perform the task and immediately be deleted. \u2026 Subject thousands or millions of copies of an emulation to varying educational techniques, \u2026 [and] use emulations that have performed best to build the template for the next \u201cgeneration\u201d of emulations, deleting the rest. \u2026 Like software companies, those improving emulation capabilities would need methods to prevent unlimited unlicensed copying of their creations. Patents and copyrights could be helpful, \u2026 but the ethical and practical difficulties would be great. \u2026 A superorganism, with shared stable values, could refrain from excess reproduction \u2026 without drawing on the legal system for enforcement.On the general abstract argument, we see a common pattern in both the evolution of species and human organizations \u2014 while winning systems often enforce substantial value sharing and loyalty on small scales, they achieve much less on larger scales. Values tend to be more integrated in a single organism\u2019s brain, relative to larger families or species, and in a team or firm, relative to a nation or world. Value coordination seems hard, especially on larger scales.This is not especially puzzling theoretically. While there can be huge gains to coordination, especially in war, it is far less obvious just how much one needs value sharing to gain action coordination. There are many other factors that influence coordination, after all; even perfect value matching is consistent with quite poor coordination.\u00a0It is also far from obvious that values in generic large minds can easily be separated from other large mind parts. When the parts of large systems evolve independently, to adapt to differing local circumstances, their values may also evolve independently. Detecting and eliminating value divergences might in general be quite expensive.In general, it is not at all obvious that the benefits of more value sharing are worth these costs. And even if more value sharing is worth the costs, that would only imply that value-sharing\u00a0entities\u00a0should be a bit larger than they are now, not that they should shift to a world-encompassing\u00a0extreme.On Shulman\u2019s more concrete argument, his suggested single-version approach to em value sharing, wherein a single central em only allows (perhaps vast numbers of) brief copies, can suffer from greatly reduced innovation. When em copies are assigned to and adapt to different tasks, there may be no easy way to merge their minds into a single common mind containing all their adaptations. The single em copy that is best at doing an average of tasks, may be much worse at each task than the best em for that task.Shulman\u2019s other concrete suggestion for sharing em values is \u201cpsychological testing, staged situations, and direct observation of their emulation software to form clear pictures of their loyalties.\u201d But genetic and cultural evolution has long tried to make human minds fit well within strongly loyal teams, a task to which we seem well adapted. This suggests that moving our minds closer to a \u201cborg\u201d team ideal would cost us somewhere else, such as in our mental agility.On the concrete coordination gains that Shulman sees from superorganism ems, most of these gains seem cheaply achievable via simple long-standard human coordination mechanisms: property rights, contracts, and trade. Individual farmers have long faced starvation if they could not extract enough food from their property, and farmers were often out-competed by others who used resources more efficiently.With ems there is the added advantage that em copies can agree to the \u201cterms\u201d of their life deals before they are created. An em would agree that it starts life with certain resources, and that life will end when it can no longer pay to live. Yes there would be some selection for humans and ems who peacefully accept such deals, but probably much less than needed to get loyal devotion to and shared values with a superorganism.Yes, with high value sharing ems might be less tempted to steal from other copies of themselves to survive. But this hardly implies that such ems no longer need property rights enforced. They\u2019d need property rights to prevent theft by copies of other ems, including being enslaved by them.  Once a property rights system exists, the additional cost of applying it within a set of em copies seems small relative to the likely costs of strong value sharing.Shulman seems to argue both that superorganisms are a natural endpoint of evolution, and that ems are especially supportive of superorganisms. But at most he has shown that ems organizations may be at a somewhat larger scale, not that they would reach civilization-encompassing scales. In general, creatures who share values can indeed coordinate better, but perhaps not by much, and it can be costly to achieve and maintain shared values. I see no coordinate-by-values free lunch.I am again glad to see Carl Shulman engage the important issue of social change given whole brain emulation, but I fear the Singularity Institute obsession with making a god to rule us all (well) had distracted him from thinking about real em life, as opposed to how ems might realize make-a-god hopes.Added 8a: To be clear, in a software-like em labor market, there will be some natural efficient scale of training, where all the workers doing some range of tasks are all copies of the same intensely trained em. All those ems will naturally find it easier to coordinate on values, and can coordinate a bit better because of that fact. There\u2019s just no particular reason to expect that to lead to much more coordination on larger scales.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: October 4, 2011 9:45 pm \nTitle: Shulman On Superorgs\nIt has come to my attention that some think that by now I should have commented on Carl Shulman\u2019s em paper Whole Brain Emulation and the Evolution of Superorganisms.

Often strong expectations. Such expectations can be called social \u201croles\u201d.For example, in a society with \u201cgender roles\u201d, there are widely shared expectations regarding the kinds of tasks that women do, relative to men.

{"completion": " It seems obvious to me that it is possible to have both overly weak and overly strong social roles. With overly strong social roles, we rely too much on initial expectations, experiment too little with alternate allocations, and act too little on any info we acquire about people as their lives progress. But with overly weak social roles, we rely too little on easily accessible info on what sorts of people are likely to end up well-suited to particular roles.For example, consider climate roles. If you grow up in a particular climate, there\u2019s a better than random chance that you will live in a similar climate when you are older. So it makes sense early in life for you to adapt to that climate in your habits and attitudes. When people are looking later for someone to live or work in that climate, it makes sense for them to prefer people already experienced with that climate. Part of this could be genetic, in that people with genes well suited to a climate may have been previously preferentially selected to live there. But it mostly doesn\u2019t matter the cause; it just makes sense to respond to these patterns in the obvious way.(Yes, sometimes one will want to pick people who seem especially badly-matched to certain tasks or context, just to experiment and check one\u2019s assumptions about matching. But such experiments are unusual as choices.)Of course the world may sometimes stumble into inefficient equilibria, wherein we keep tending to assign certain sorts of people to certain tasks, when we\u2019d be even better off with some other pattern of who does what. In such cases we might try to break out of previous patterns, in part via discouraging people from using some features as cues to assigning some aspects of tasks, locations, associations, etc. This is one possible justification for \u201canti-discrimination\u201d rules and laws.But this certainly doesn\u2019t justify a general prohibition on any sorts of social roles whatsoever. And any decisions based on theories saying that we were in inefficient equilibria should be periodically re-examined, to see if observed patterns of who seems to be good at what support such theories. We might have been mistaken. And unless there is some market failure that we must continually fight against, we should expect to need anti-discrimination rules only for a limited time, until new and better equilibria can be reached.Yes, among the features that we can use to estimate who is fit for what roles, some of those features are easier for individuals to change, while others are harder to change. However, it isn\u2019t clear why this distinction matters that much re the suitability of such features for task assignment. Even when features can change, there will be a cost of such changes, and so it will often be more cost-effective to use people who already have the suitable features, instead of getting other people to change to become suitable.From a conversation with John Nye.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: November 25, 2019 1:30 pm \nTitle: Social Roles Make Sense\nThe modern world relies greatly on a vast division of labor, wherein we each do quite different tasks.

The structure provides a \ufb01xed link between ground and near space locations enabling the transportation of equipment, personnel and other objects or people to platforms or pods above the surface of the Earth for the purpose of scienti\ufb01c research, communications and tourism. The device may be assembled from the surface upwards, avoiding dif\ufb01cult and expensive in-orbit construction. The space-elevator tower can provide access to lower altitude regions and can also be scaled to access altitudes above 15 km, or the typical ceiling altitude for commercial aviation. The approach may be further scaled to provide direct access to altitudes above 200 km and with the gravitation potential of Low Earth Orbit without the technical challenges associated with constructing a cable at least 35,000 km long. The elevator platforms also have signi\ufb01cant advantages over orbiting satellite platforms. Geographically \ufb01xed but providing access to regions of space closer to the surface than geostationary orbit, elevator platforms provide the ideal means to communicate over a wide area and to conduct remote sensing and tourism activities. As a tourist destination, the elevator platforms provide stations located at \ufb01xed attitudes from the surface for observation. The elevator platforms provide the means to access safely a region of space with a view extending hundreds of kilometers. \u2026Consider an example core-structure design for an Earth-based elevator to access near space at 20 km altitude. Advantageously, to access orbit, the elevator could be constructed at 5 km altitude in one of four regions on the equator. The core would be required to span a further 15 km altitude. Based on Elevator B, a suitable structure comprises of gas cells with constant wall thickness 1.2 cm arranged in a torus of inner diameter 228 m and outer diameter 230 m. Fabricated from Boron, a 15 km elevator structure can be supported by 150 bar hydrogen gas. Approximating the structure as two concentric cylinders, the mass of the structure is 6.5\u00d710^8kg, and the mass of the pressurization gas needed is 1.4\u00d710^8kg. Other core designs may be analyzed by comparison with the two-cylinder design and by appropriate adjustment for the amount of wall material utilized.Constructed at 5 km altitude, the structure would have a buoyant mass of 3.1\u00d710^6kg giving a total mass of 7.8\u00d710^8kg. The load capacity of the structure, in excess of that needed to support itself, is 3.1\u00d710^8kg of force equivalent. The critical buckling load at the top is 4.1\u00d710^9N, and at the center of gravity (located at 7.3 km up the core) the critical load is 1.6\u00d710^9N, which exceeds signi\ufb01cantly the dead weight load of the building, including the mass of the gas, indicating that the core would be structurally stable and able to support the raising of payloads of mass in excess of 10^6 kg. By further tapering the wall thickness, further design margin may be obtained by lowering the center of gravity and reducing the structural mass, or taller structures may be constructed. Alternatively, the core diameters can be tapered to increase the structural stiffness in the base, although the variation of core diameter may be undesirable for mounting elevator machinery. Additionally, the core can be segmented and pressurized equivalently without inducing an imbalance of support forces between segment walls. \u2026Consider a highly simpli\ufb01ed scenario where a single stage-to-orbit rocket is launched to a typical circular orbital height of 120 km. \u2026 Comparing initial to \ufb01nal rocket-mass ratios, the elevator launch at 20 km is shown to be 26% more ef\ufb01cient than the equivalent ground launch.Added 13June: If you search for \u201cSpace Tower\u201d you\u2019ll see Alexander\u00a0Bolonkin has published over a half dozen times (eg 1 2 3) on inflatable space towers since 2002.\u00a0 But the  Acta Astronautica article doesn\u2019t cite him at all.\u00a0 Suspicious.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: June 12, 2009 2:30 pm \nTitle: Space Towers\nLong ago kings and empires often signaled their power via impressive buildings, such as temples, cathedrals, and pyramids.\u00a0\u00a0 Today, cities and corporations often similarly signal via big skyscrapers, bridges, and ships.\u00a0 But for nations, the fraction of\u00a0 wealth spent on a single showy construction has dramatically decreased.\u00a0 Space programs serve a similar function, but don\u2019t leave such huge monuments to admire.A new  Acta Astronautica article suggests this trend may reverse.\u00a0 New Scientist reports:A giant inflatable tower could carry people to the edge of space without the need for a rocket, and could be completed much sooner than a cable-based space elevator, its proponents claim. \u2026 The team envisages assembling the structure from a series of modules constructed from Kevlar-polyethylene composite tubes made rigid by inflating them with a lightweight gas such as helium.To test the idea, they built a 7-metre scale model made up of six modules.\u00a0 \u2026 The team [also mathematically] modelled a 15-kilometre tower made up of 100 modules, each one 150 metres tall and 230 metres in diameter, built from inflatable tubes 2 metres across.

{"completion": " In larger political and cultural conflicts, different factions fight for control over larger social levers of influence. This includes core government positions of leadership. But in a democracy, those tend to be controlled by whomever can gain a majority of the popular vote. And as voters are ignorant and fickle, gaining them can be expensive and uncertain for factions. Yes, if you can get people with money to donate to your cause, you might use that to help attract voters. But as donors are also ignorant and fickle, you also compete with other political factions to attract donations, just as you compete for voters.\u00a0Which is why cultural and political factions also seek other more secure bases \u2013 the commanding heights of culture. For example, with an independent judiciary, politicians may not directly control who are the new judges, or their choices may be highly constrained to be acceptable to current judges. In this case, once your political faction controls most judges, you can use that base of power to ensure that only folks who prove they are loyal to your faction become judges. Then your side can set laws and their interpretation to support your political and cultural agendas. Similarly, if your faction can control the schools, or the news media, then you can use those to spread your agenda.\u00a0Now if control over such heights were simply owned and bought with money, then they would be commanding heights of business, but not of culture. For example, if there were a business monopoly that controlled all the media, then you could get it to teach everyone your agenda, but only if you paid it more for that coverage than did your rival political factions. Yes, you might persuade its owners to donate to your cause, via giving up some business revenue to help to your cause. But that\u2019s just competing for donors again.We get a similar effect if you can\u2019t directly buy control over an area, but that area is still controlled for profit. For example, labor unions might be controlled by leaders seeking mainly to personally profit, on behalf of union members who expect to personally profit from union actions. In this case, a union will only choose to ally with outside groups, or to support their agendas, when those outside groups reciprocally support that union. These sort of unions can be part of an alliance, but they are not otherwise commanding heights of political power.\u00a0So a central feature of the commanding heights of cultural conflict is that they are not bought with money, directly or indirectly. They are instead acquired via political conflict between groups demonstrating their political loyalty to a faction. Oh there may be for-profit firms involved, but those firms are not in full control; there are also professionals who can enforce their own standards. Maybe one of the reason that many do not like such areas to be bought completely with money is that they instead prefer them to be commanding heights, places from which factions can more securely influence society.In business, you don\u2019t make much net profits when you are in strong competition with rivals. You might then just barely stay in business, paying almost as much to your suppliers as you get from customers. Similarly in cultural conflict, a faction can\u2019t gain much power and security if it is constantly competing for the allegiance of fickle voters and donors. A faction instead gains stable power, and thus profits, when it controls areas not via for-profit priorities, but via political loyalties. Pushing out those who don\u2019t show sufficient allegiance to their political side, and then using that area to promote its agenda elsewhere.\u00a0I see three reasons why a faction might be less eager to control an area of life in this way. One is that control there doesn\u2019t let you push your agenda very much elsewhere. For example, it is harder to push larger cultural agendas via the construction process, relative to development policies of what is built where. And it is harder to promote a cultural agenda via control over the engineering of system back-ends and internals, relative to the design of features and policies that users see and use.\u00a0A second reason to be less eager to control an area is when there is a strong competition for who does which roles how there. For example, if positions on sporting teams are chosen via fierce competitions of sport ability, there may remain too little slack to allow politically-aligned folks in that area to favor people from their side. Making it hard for a political faction to usefully control that area. It may be similar for musicians or actors. An area is only tempting to control if some key people there have enough slack and discretion to be able to favor choosing their political allies, even when those favorites are not quite as good or productive in the usual sense there. \u00a0A third reason to be less eager to control an area is if people there have neutrality norms that say to not use dominance in one area to favor sides in larger political or cultural conflicts. For example, most Western militaries have such a norm. That is, internal factions may struggle for control of militaries, and they might even happen to correlate with larger political factions. But they are not to use control over the military to favor their side in the larger social world. Many parts of police and legal systems have also shared similar norms.\u00a0Academia, law, and journalism also once had stronger\u00a0neutrality\u00a0norms, before the left came to dominate them more.\u00a0Back in 2014 I wrote:Jobs that lean conservative: soldier, police, doctor, religious worker, insurance broker. These seem to be jobs where there are rare big bad things that can go wrong, and you want workers who can help keep them from happening. That explanation can also makes some sense of these other conservative jobs: grader & sorter, electrical contractor, car dealer, trucker, coal miner, construction worker, gas service station worker, non-professor scientist. Conservatives are more focused on fear of bad things, and protecting against them.Now consider some jobs that lean liberal: professor, journalist, artist, musician, author. Here you might see these jobs as having rare but big upsides. Maybe the focus is on small chances that a worker will cause a rare huge success. This is plausibly the opposite of a conservative focus on rare big losses.But consider these other liberal jobs: psychiatrist, lawyer, teacher. Here the focus may just be on people who talk well. And that can also make sense of many of the previous list of liberal jobs. It might also makes sense of another big liberal job: civil servant.So for a while now the left has controlled the commanding heights of academia, law, journalism, art, and civil service, while the right has controlled medicine, religion, military, police, insurance, construction, and engineering. Recently the left seems to have taken control of two areas previously controlled by the right: medicine, and social tech. This seems to have resulted from the left very strongly controlling elite colleges, the source of new elites in medicine and social tech. The recent academic trend toward dropping objective test scores from college admissions will allow more admissions discretion, which enables more political favoritism.Not only does the right seem to be on the retreat re controlling commanding heights of culture, the areas that the right still controls seem less valuable as they are (1) more behind the scenes (engineering and construction), (2) more objectively competitive (e.g., sports), and (3) have stronger neutrality norms (e.g., military, police).\u00a0Perhaps the right will\u00a0reconsider its neutrality norms, if it takes recent history to suggest that the\u00a0left\u00a0will not continue them if it takes over such areas.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: June 14, 2020 9:15 pm \nTitle: The Commanding Heights of Culture\nIn war, each side strives to control the \u201ccommanding heights\u201d.

For those of us now used to farmer and industry levels of social opacity, this transparency might take some getting used to. But it is likely well within the range of human adaptability.The more interesting question to me is what happens when we have both kinds of tech, say face readers to show subtle micro expressions but also masks to block such reading. Voice readers to read subtle tones and voice modifiers to hide such tells. Which techs will we actually deploy?On the one hand, we might expect people who are socially close, such as families or teams, to encourage internal transparency and discourage opacity aids. This might be seen as a sign of trust and a basis for close coordination.

New transparency techs may just bring back forager levels of social visibility, levels to which humans are already quite well adapted.In the modern world, people often interact with others about whom they know far less than their forager ancestors knew, and with far greater abilities to consciously manage appearances.  For example, when firms and nations now deal with each other, they can often spend days thinking about their next response, and have large teams studying what that response should be. And yet it mostly works out ok.\n\n###\n\n"}

{"completion": " Here\u2019s a simple\u00a0and pretty standard theory of the origin and history of life and intelligence. Life can exist in a supporting oasis (e.g., Earth\u2019s surface) that has a volume V and metabolism M per unit volume, and which lasts for a time window W between forming and then later ending. This oasis makes discrete \u201cadvances\u201d between levels over time, and at any one time the entire oasis is at the same level. For example, an oasis may start at the level of simple dead chemical activity, may later rise to a level that counts as \u201clife\u201d, then rise to a level that includes \u201cintelligence\u201d, and finally to a level where civilization makes a big loud noises that are visible as clearly artificial from far away in the universe.There can be different kinds of levels, each with a different process for stepping to the next level. For example, at a \u201cdelay\u201d level, the oasis takes a fixed time delay D to move to the next level. At a \u201ctry once\u201d level, the oasis has a particular probability of immediately stepping to the next level, and if it fails at that it stays forever \u201cstuck\u201d, which is equivalent to a level with an infinite delay. And at a \u201ctry try\u201d level, the oasis stays at a level while it searches for an \u201cinnovation\u201d to allow it to step to the next level. This search produces a constant rate per unit time of jumping. As an oasis exists for only a limited window W, it may never reach high levels, and in fact may never get beyond its first try-try level.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: December 3, 2020 9:00 pm \nTitle: Try-Try or Try-Once Great Filter?\n\n###\n\n"}
{"completion": " If we consider a high level above many hard try-try levels, and with small enough values of V,M,W, then any one oasis may have a very small chance of \u201csucceeding\u201d at reaching that high level before its window ends. In this case, there is a \u201cgreat filter\u201d that stands between the initial state of the oasis and a final success state. Such a success would then only tend to happen somewhere if there are enough similar oases going through this process, to overcome these small odds at each oasis. And if we know that very few of many similar such oases actually succeed, then we know that each must face a great filter. For example, knowing that we humans now can see no big loud artificial activity for a very long distance from us tells us that planets out there face a great filter between their starting level and that big loud level.Each try-try type level has an expected time E to step to the next level, a time that goes inversely as V*M. After all, the more volume there is of stuff that tries, and faster its local activity, the more chances it has to find an innovation. A key division between such random levels is between ones in which this expected time E is much less than, or much greater than, the oasis window W. When E << W, these jumps are fast and \u201ceasy\u201d, and so levels change relatively steadily over time, at a rate proportional to V*M. And when E >> W, then these jumps are so \u201chard\u201d that most oases never succeed at them.Let us focus for now on oases that face a great filter, have no try-once steps, and yet succeed against the odds. There are some useful patterns to note here. First, let\u2019s set aside S, the sum of the delays D for delay steps, and of the expected times E for easy try-try steps, for all such steps between the initial level and the success level. Such an oasis then really only has a time duration of about W-S to do all its required hard try-try steps.The first pattern to note is that the chance that an oasis does all these hard steps within its window W is proportional to (V*M*(W-S))N, where N is the number of these hard steps needed to reach its success level. So if we are trying to predict which of many differing oases is mostly likely to succeed, this is the formula to use.The second pattern to note is that if an oasis succeeds in doing all its required hard steps within its W-S duration, then the time durations required to do each of the hard steps are all drawn from the same (roughly exponential) distribution, regardless of the value of E for those steps! Also, the time remaining in the oasis after the success level has been reached is also drawn from this same distribution. This makes concrete predictions about the pattern of times in the historical record of a successful oasis.Now let\u2019s try to compare this theory to the history of life on Earth. The first known fossils of cells seems to be from 0.1-0.5 Ga (billion years) after life would be possible on Earth, which happened about 4.2 Gya (billion years ago), which was about 9.6 Ga after the universe formed. The window remaining for (eukaryotic) life to remain on Earth seems 0.8-1.5 Ga. The relatively steady growth in max brain sizes since multi-cellular life arose 0.5 Gya suggests that during this period there were many easy, but no hard, try-try steps. Multi-celluar life seems to require sufficient oxygen in the atmosphere, but the process of collecting enough oxygen seems to have started about 2.4 Gya, implying a long 1.9 Ga delay step. Prokaryotes started exchanging genes about 2.0 Gya, eukaryotes appeared about 1.7 Gya, and modern sex appeared about 1.2 Gya. These events may or may not have been the result of successful try-try steps.Can we test this history against the predictions that try-try hard step durations, and the window time remaining, should all be drawn from the same roughly exponential distribution? Prokaryote sex, eukaryotes, and modern sex all appeared within 0.8 Ga, which seems rather close together, and leaving a long uneventful period of almost ~2 Ga before them. The clearest hard step duration candidates are before the first life, which took 0.0-0.5 Ga, and the window remaining of 0.8-1.5 Ga, which could be pretty different durations. Overall I\u2019d say that while this data isn\u2019t a clear refutation of the same hard step distribution hypothesis, it also isn\u2019t that much of a confirmation.What about the prediction that the chance of oasis success is proportional to (V*M*(W-S))N? The prediction about Earth is that it will tend to score high on this metric, as Earth is the only example of success that we know.Let\u2019s consider some predictions in turn, starting with metabolism M. Life of the sort that we know seems to allow only a limited range of temperatures, and near a star that requires a limited range of distances from the star, which then implies a limited range of metabolisms M. As a result of this limited range of possible M, our prediction that oases with larger M will have higher chances of success doesn\u2019t have much room to show itself. But for what its worth, Earth seems to be nearer to the inner than outer edge of the Sun\u2019s allowable zone, giving it a higher value of M. So that\u2019s a weak confirmation of the theory, though it would be stronger if the allowed zone range were larger than most authors now estimate.What about volume V? The radii of non-gas-giant planets seems to be lognormally distributed, with Earth at the low end of the distribution (at a value of 1 on this axis):\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: December 3, 2020 9:00 pm \nTitle: Try-Try or Try-Once Great Filter?\nHere\u2019s a simple\u00a0and pretty standard theory of the origin and history of life and intelligence.

Imagine also that more such clusters of continents are spread all along this tube, spaced roughly twenty Earth circumferences apart. In between is mostly open ocean, with a few small islands.The tube slowly gets colder millions of km from its center, as those places are further from it sun. Life is spread all along the tube, but so far humans and civilization have only evolved on one near-center cluster of continents. It would take an old style (~12 knot) sailing ship about 4 years to travel in a straight line from one cluster to another, and it would take a jet airliner about 40 days to fly there. Both would need refueling along the way.My big question here is: how would history, and economic growth, have played out differently on Tube Earth? With all that land out there to colonize, how much more activity would be dedicated to spreading out across the tube? How far would be the furthest flag, subsistence farming town, and modern industrial city at any one time?My guess is that Tube Earth would look a lot more like our Earth than most space colonization fans expect. Explorers would not have even reached the nearest other continent cluster until the 1800s, and even now there\u2019d be only a few small colonizes there, mostly practicing subsistence agriculture. A several year shipping time would make it very expensive to import modern equipment, and greatly discourage the shipping of mining minerals or farmed food back to the central cluster. Mostly they\u2019d work harder to get more minerals and food from nearby mines and farms.By 2010 Tube Earth would be lucky to have one monthly airline flight to the next cluster, and a very expensive but welcomed internet connection. Lots of stories would take place there, and it would offer an escape for well-off religious or political refuges.

They plan to sell gas and snacks to the truck drivers who come out to deliver gas and snacks. Want to invest?No? How about if they also sell gas and snacks to passing explorers, out there to signal toughness? Yes, explorers won\u2019t look as tough if they buy gas and snacks from your station. But if the station can lure enough not-so-tough explorers, maybe you\u2019d want to invest.How about if they also plan to dig oil wells and an oil refinery to make the gas they sell, and a hothouse farm and food processing factory, to grow food for the snacks they sell? How about if they plan to run all this entirely by robots? This plan would make me even less likely to invest. After all, you\u2019d need even more customers to justify a larger scale operation, and I had doubts about enough explorer customers to justify a simple gas station.This is my reaction to the recent news that some famous investors will spend millions trying to mine asteroids (see here, here, here). Their first product would be rocket fuel to sell to passing NASA rockets. I\u2019m skeptical that NASA wants to buy enough fuel to cover their costs, and I don\u2019t see a flood of other customers eager for robot space gas stations. This new firm also talks about shipping metals like platinum back to Earth, but that seems even crazier anytime soon.To explore this general issue, let us imagine Tube Earth. While our Earth is a sphere of rock with a 40,000 km circumference, Tube Earth is a very long cylinder of rock with a circumference 1/6 as large, to give it the same surface gravity as Earth. Tube Earth also rotates 24 hours in a day, and has a sun nearby. \u00a0The closest spot on the tube to the sun is its \u201ccenter,\u201d which has Earth-like average surface temperature and seasonal variation.

{"completion": " Last year, researchers detected about a dozen nomad planets, using a technique called gravitational microlensing, which looks for stars whose light is momentarily refocused by the gravity of passing planets. The research produced evidence that roughly two nomads exist for every typical, so-called main-sequence star in our galaxy. The new study estimates that nomads may be up to 50,000 times more common than that. (more)This new study was theoretical. It used a best fit power law fit to the distribution of nomad planet microlensing observations to predict ~60 Pluto sized or larger nomad planets per star. \u00a0When projected down to the comet scale, this power law actually matches known bounds on comet density.  The 95% c.l. upper bound for the power law parameter gives 100,000 such wandering Plutos or larger per star.I take all this as weak support for something in the direction of these contrarian theories \u2013 there are more nomad planets than theorists expected, and some of that may come from neglect of early universe turbulence. But thirty million nomad Plutos per star still seems pretty damn unlikely.FYI, here is part of an email I sent the authors in mid December, as yet unanswered:The argument [of yours] I\u2019ve found most persuasive and understandable is presented here: http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9904260v1  It says that the usual calculations based on observations suggesting little turbulence in oceans, atmospheres etc. neglect the fact that a tiny fraction of space-time volume where it happens can dominate overall mixing rates. The fact that real mixing seems to be vastly larger does support your claims that rare turbulence is an important contribution to real mixing.But the argument I most want to evaluate is your claim that planet sized objects formed quickly after the universe first turned transparent to light. That seems to be based on a claim that there are gravity instability modes where density increases locally yet pressure remains constant across space. A little searching finds papers like this: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physleta.2007.09.069 that do explicit perturbation analysis yet don\u2019t find such modes. Computer simulations also don\u2019t seem to find them. Your response seems to be that these neglect non-linearities and the complexity of turbulence. Yet the arguments you give, at least the ones that I have found, such as in http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0610628v1 , seem to be simple perturbation arguments. I keep wondering: what complexity-respecting theory are they perturbations of?Somehow you seem to be postulating a small fraction of turbulence at the transparency transition that had very disproportionate effects in promoting gravitational instabilities. You have in mind some model of the average changes under rare turbulence that support unstable constant pressure density fluctuations. Yet most cosmologists don\u2019t see those as possible. So where exactly is your most detailed argument for the existence of such instabilities in a scenario of mild and/or rare turbulence?I also never got an answer to this one:This paper: http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1993/1993_Goldman_Canuto.pdfgives the sort of more detailed calculation that I was looking to find in your papers.How much does your analysis disagree with their analysis?\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: February 28, 2012 8:40 am \nTitle: Turbulence Contrarians\nA few months ago I came across an intriguing contrarian theory:Hydrogravitional-dynamics (HGD) cosmology \u2026 predicts \u2026 Earth-mass planets fragmented from plasma at 300 Kyr [after the big bang].

Alas, for Covid-19 and the world, this has mostly failed, though not yet everywhere.The next biggest win is to find a cheap effective treatment, such as a vaccine.

As soon as your body notices an infection, it immediately tries to grow a response, while the virus tries to grow itself. From then on, it is a race to see which can grow biggest fastest. And the virus gets a big advantage in this race if its initial dose of infecting virus is larger.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: March 30, 2020 12:00 am \nTitle: Variolation (+ Isolation) May Cut Covid19 Deaths 3-30X\n\n###\n\n"}
{"completion": " This isn\u2019t just a theory. The medical literature consistently finds strong relations, in both animals and humans, between initial virus dose and symptom severity, including death. The most directly relevant data is on SARS and measles, where natural differences in doses were associated with factors of 3 and 14 in death rates, and in smallpox, where in the 1700s low \u201cvariolation\u201d doses given on purpose cut death rates by a factor of 10 to 30. For example, variolation saved George Washington\u2019s troops at Valley Forge.Early on, it can be worth paying such high costs to end a pandemic. But once a pandemic seems likely to eventually infect most everyone, it becomes less clear whether lockdowns are a net win. However, the dose effect that lockdowns exacerbate, by increasing dose size, also offers a huge opportunity to slash deaths, via voluntary infection with very low doses. (As others have\u00a0been\u00a0also\u00a0been suggesting.)Just as replacing accidental smallpox infections with deliberate low dose infections cut smallpox deaths by a factor of 10 to 30, a factor of 3-30 is plausible for Covid19 death rate cuts due to replacing accidental Covid19 infections with deliberate small dose infections. Observed mortality differences due to natural dose variations give only a lower bound on what is feasible via controlled doses. Of course we can\u2019t be sure until we get more direct evidence. But\u00a0systematic variolation experiments involving at most a few thousand volunteers seem sufficient to get evidence not only on death rates, but also to verify immunity and to learn ideal infection doses, delivery methods, entry points, and strains, and also the value of complementary drugs to slow viral replication (e.g., remdesivir). (Even a hundred volunteers could find a good low dose.)This dose size advantage adds to several other substantial advantages of variolation. Not only does it offer controlled conditions for studying disease progression, and for training medical personnel, it can also help ensure consistent staffing of critical workers, by spacing out their infections.Furthermore, the combination of variolation with immediate isolation until recovery \u201cflattens the curve,\u201d by spreading out medical demand over time, and also adding to the herd immunity that usually ends a pandemic. So even without a death rate cut due to lower doses, this strategy produces a net social gain.This last claim may sound counter-intuitive, but it has in fact recently been confirmed in three independently developed simulations. For example, in a simulation where old and sick people are selected for isolation, while only the young and healthy are eligible for variolation, there are 40% fewer life years lost, compared to no variolation and random selection for isolation. Each variolation volunteer suffers only an additional 0.20% chance of death to save a random other person from a 6.5% chance. And these simulations ignore any benefits of low doses; they hold constant the infection and death rates, and the total quantity of social isolation, and thus expense.Of course, if low doses cut death rates by a factor of two or more, variolation volunteers would actually cut their chance of death, perhaps greatly. Yes, the first few thousand volunteers could be less sure of such gains, but they could be compensated for this risk, just as we now consider compensating subjects in vaccine trials using live Covid19 viruses. We could pay variolation volunteers cash, offer their loved ones priority medical care, certify them as safe for work and social gatherings, and honor them like soldiers selected for their elite features who take risks to produce community gains.So the scenario is this: Hero Hotels welcome sufficiently young and healthy volunteers. Friends and family can enter together, and remain together. A cohort enters together, and is briefly isolated individually for as long as it takes to verify that they\u2019ve been infected with a very small dose of the virus. They can then interact freely with each other, those those that show symptoms are isolated more. They can\u2019t leave until tests show they have recovered.In a Hero Hotel, volunteers have a room, food, internet connection, and full medical care. Depending on available funding from government or philanthropic sources, volunteers might either pay to enter, get everything for free, or be paid a bonus to enter. Health plans of volunteers may even contribute to the expense.Those who work in medicine or critical infrastructure seem especially valuable candidates for early variolation; volunteers might be offered larger bonuses. Once they have recovered, they are more surely available to work near the pandemic peak, and can more easily risk social contact at work.Note that this strategy of variolation plus isolation requires no government support, nor loss of personal freedom, just the sort of legal permission sometimes given to administrators and volunteers of vaccine trials. And this comparison with vaccine trial policy can be emphasized to those tempted to see this policy as repulsive. Variolation policy offers similar social gains, and may require similar voluntary personal sacrifices. Hero hotels can even be good places to do vaccine trials.Note also that there is no minimum scale required to make this policy beneficial. Even variolation of only a few is still a social gain compared to none at all. A small early trial could generate much useful attention and discussion regarding this strategy, to inspire application in this and future pandemics. Furthermore, the optimal time to stop this practice for personal reasons is probably close to the optimal time to stop for social reasons, so choice of stopping date needn\u2019t be heavily regulated.Some fear that it is now too late to consider variolation, as the pandemic peak may be only a few weeks away. But lockdowns may succeed in substantially slowing Covid19 growth, and we may then be in for many months or years of alternating local waves of suppression and reappearance. Furthermore, if low doses cut death rates enough, variolation can make sense even at the pandemic peak, when medical resources are stretched most thin. For example, for a factor of 3 cut in death rates, variolation replaces three sick patients with one similarly sick patient, lowering total medical demand.As variolation doesn\u2019t much change the total number who are ever infected, it doesn\u2019t give the virus more total chances to evolve. In fact, while accidental infections risk selection for versions that infect people more easily, voluntary infections avoid this problematic effect.While you might think policy wonks would be eager to cut Covid19 death rates by a factor of 3-30, few have so far been attracted to discuss or pursue this concept. It seems to push the wrong buttons in many people. So if you are a rare exception who finds the concept plausible, you can get a disproportionate policy leverage by working on a neglected important option. You might help in one of these areas:\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: March 30, 2020 12:00 am \nTitle: Variolation (+ Isolation) May Cut Covid19 Deaths 3-30X\n(Here I try to put my recent arguments together into an integrated essay, suitable for recommending to others.)When facing a new pandemic, the biggest win is to end it fast, so that few ever suffer.

This might work, but success depends not just on the money you pay; it also depends much more on your effort, abilities, and other context. In principle, you might be able to execute this plan without any money, but typically more money will make such a plan a bit easier. So, yes, in this weak sense, you can \u201cbuy\u201d oranges with money.At an ordinary grocery store, however, you can buy oranges much more directly. You go to the produce section, look for the orange color, walk to the pile of oranges, take as many as you want, and pay the price per orange at the register. Or at a full service grocery, you might just say \u201csix oranges please\u201d and a grocer would go find and bag them for you.

{"completion": " The most encouraging talk I heard at TED 2017 was by David Brenner on his efforts to disinfect human spaces. Apparently there are frequencies of ultraviolet (UV) light that don\u2019t penetrate skin past the top layer of dead skin cells, but still penetrate all the way through almost all bacteria and viruses in the air and on smooth-enough\u00a0surfaces. So we should be able to use special UV lights to easily disinfect surfaces around humans. For example, we might cheaply sterilize whole hospitals. And maybe also airports during\u00a0pandemics. This seems an obvious no brainer that should have been possible anytime in the last century (assuming they\u2019ve done penetration-depth vs.\u00a0frequency measurements right). Yet Brenner has been working on this for five years and still seems far from getting regulatory approval. This seems to me a bad case of civilization and regulatory failure. Even so, the potential remains\u00a0great.The most discouraging talk I heard was by Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank Group. He talked about how he fought the World Bank for years, because they insisted on using cost-effectiveness criteria to pick medical investments. He showed us pictures of particular people helped by less cost-effective treatments, daring us to say they were not worth helping. And he said people in poor nations have status-based \u201caspirations\u201d for the same sort of hospitals and schools found in rich nations, even if they aren\u2019t cost-effective, and who are we to tell them no. Now that he runs the World Bank (nominated by Obama in 2012), his priorities can now win more. The audience cheered. \ud83d\ude41All strong religions seem to need some implausible beliefs, and perhaps for TED one of them is the idea we need only point out problems to good people, to have those problems solved. But if not, then what I think TED audiences most need to hear are basic reviews on the topics of market failure and regulatory costs.At TED 2017 I heard many talks where speakers point out a way that our world is not ideal. For example, speakers talked about how tech firms compete to entice users to just pay attention to them, how cities seem to be spread out more than is ideal, and how inner city grocery stores have less fresh food. But speakers never attributed problems to a particular standard kind of market failure, much less suggest a particular institutional solution because it matched the kind of market failure it was to address. While speakers tend to imply government regulation and redistribution as solutions, they never consider the many ways that regulation and redistribution can go wrong and be costly.It is as if TED audiences, who hear talks on a great specialized many areas of science and tech, were completely unaware of key long-established and strongly-relevant areas of scholarship. If TED audiences were instead well informed about institution design, market failures, and regulatory costs, then a speaker who pointed out a problem would be expected to place it within our standard classifications of ways that things can go wrong. They\u2019d be expected to pick the standard kind of institutional solution to each kind of problem, or explain why their particular problem needs an unusual solution. And they\u2019d be expected to address\u00a0the standard ways that such a solution could be costly or go wrong. Perhaps even adjust their solution to deal with case-specific costs and failure modes.None of this is about left vs. right, it is just about good policy analysis. But perhaps this is just a bridge too far. Until the wider public becomes informed about these things, maybe TED speakers must also assume that their audience is ignorant of them as well. But if TED wants to better help the world to actually solve its problems, this is what its audience most needs to hear.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: May 6, 2017 12:45 pm \nTitle: What TED Needs\nMost people want, and gain value from, religious-like communities, strongly bonded by rituals, mutual aid, and implausible beliefs.

{"completion": " When solar is cheaper than coal or oil, that will include the cost of supporting infrastructure, such as building power plants. But since we\u2019ll still have lots of old plants and infrastructure, we\u2019ll still use a lot of carbon. And since places vary in the relative attractiveness of using carbon or solar power, we may even build more carbon plants after that point. Solar getting cheaper than carbon would show up in a gradual fall in global investment in coal infrastructure relative to an alternative still-full-carbon history, and a gradual rise in investment in solar infrastructure.A transition driven by price lines crossing in twenty years would have very little impact on current stock or commodity prices. At ordinary discount rates used for business investment, returns after twenty years hardly matter. And changing tech and business conditions make today\u2019s top solar firms a poor vehicle for investing in a transition twenty years hence. Of course current stock prices would probably show signs of a price-line crossing if investors expected it to happen in five years. So that scenario can probably be excluded.This is one of the reasons we could really use long term prediction markets, to more clearly see our distant future.

But in fact such humans have usually not been full trusted, free, or responsible. Among foragers, the band as a whole, discussing together, was more of an \u201cadult\u201d, trusted to limit the behavior of band members. Later on, during the farmer/herder era, family clans were more the \u201cadults\u201d, held responsible for member behavior and able to limit those individuals. Larger nations and empires have also been treated by the world as \u201cadults\u201d, free to choose and to be destroyed. And at times such units have decided to limit the freedoms of particular family clans, treating them as less than fully adult.Such higher level \u201cadult\u201d social units have at times treated particular fully grown humans as also \u201cadult\u201d, judging them to be sufficiently reliable and responsible to be treated in that way. But many other fully grown humans have been treated more as dependents. And the usual rule has been that such dependents must be associated with particular controlling adults who were more reliable and could be more held more responsible.The industrial revolution was primarily driven by the rise of new larger orgs, such as for-profits, non-profits, and government agencies. (Science & tech were side effects of those new orgs.) And once such orgs became available, we soon came to treat them as the main \u201cadults\u201d of our world. Such orgs are arguably just smarter and more thoughtful and reliable than individual humans. They are now trusted to manage our most important activities, and are allowed to make deals and relations with each other quite freely, with almost no regulations.Today we do not treat most fully grown humans as fully \u201cadult\u201d; we instead require each such human to pair up with a nation-state. Nation-states then limit the choices of their fully grown human members, and are held responsible by other nations-states for the actions of such members. We also usually support a norm that humans should be free to switch nations, if the new nation will take them. Nations don\u2019t always play well with each other, but no other orgs at that level can force them to behave better.However, I propose that we seriously consider instead treating smaller organizations (for-profits and non-profits) as the main responsible \u201cadults\u201d with which we pair each fully grown human. These smaller orgs are arguably on average even smarter, more thoughtful, and more reliable than are nations, they arguably play better with each other, and we are more willing and able to hold them strictly responsible.Furthermore, these are the orgs that we actually trust to do most of our important activities. Competition between such orgs is what mainly ensures adaptation and innovation in our world, far more than does competition between nation-states. And allowing humans to choose between these as their adults gives them far more effective choice than when choosing between nations.Today employers are in part treated as \u201cadults\u201d relative to their employees. And requiring each fully grown human to pair up with a sufficiently responsible firm is the essence of my \u201cvouching\u201d proposal for criminal law reform. The main formal requirement to be a voucher is having enough money to pay client fines, which makes such an org much easier to hold responsible for they and client actions. In addition, I expect most to be for-profit firms, and thus smarter and more reliable than are most fully-grown humans. With vouchers responsible for individual behavior, and able to regulate that behavior, we\u2019d have less need for government regulation to limit individual behavior.Compared to themselves, children see their parents taking on more important roles in the world, being held more responsible for their actions, being more careful in their choices, and being more free to choose as they like. While most children eventually grow into such roles, many are disappointed to learn that few fully grown humans are treated fully as ideal \u201cadults\u201d. In our world, that role is reserved for nation-states.Some are so disappointed to learn this that they propose \u201clibertarian\u201d reforms to make fully grown humans be the \u201cadults\u201d of our world, mostly unregulated and strongly responsible for their actions. If you ask them why children should not also be treated this way, a few will bite that bullet, but most will point to children being less reliable, thoughtful, and knowledgable, and to our being less willing to hold them fully responsible for their actions.But even though my intuitions pull libertarian, I have to admit that many fully grown humans also look this way, at least compared to our larger orgs. (Three recent movies, Nitram, Red Rocket, and Fourteen, brought this point home to me.) Such humans can also be pretty random, unreliable, and unthoughtful, and knowing this fact most people aren\u2019t willing to hold them fully responsible for their actions, and are willing to authorize regulation instead to greatly limit their behavior.However, even though we aren\u2019t willing to treat most children as ideal \u201cadults\u201d, this doesn\u2019t mean that nation-states must directly manage them. Instead we all understand that it probably works better to tie each young human to a fully grown human, who is more thoughtful than, and can be held more responsible than, that child.So similarly, even if we also aren\u2019t willing to treat most fully grown humans as ideal \u201cadults\u201d, this also doesn\u2019t mean that they should be directly subject to limitations by nation-states. As we can instead tie each fully grown human to a larger voucher org, who we are in fact willing to treat as an ideal \u201cadult\u201d. Because such orgs are in fact more thoughtful, reliable, and able to be held responsible, and we are more willing to actually hold them strictly responsible.To review, the concept \u201cadult\u201d has two parts, a social role that can be filled, and a description of who fills that role. The role is that of the thoughtful reliable responsible party, who can be trusted to do important things, who can be given great discretion re how to do them, and who can manage non-adults. In the context of small families, then compared to their children to a first approximation that adult role can be filled by fully grown parents.However, in our larger society we do not in fact trust most fully grown humans to fully fill that role, as we have available to us more thoughtful, reliable, and responsible orgs. We have so far been putting nation-states into the ideal adult role.But I argue that we\u2019d do better to put smaller orgs in that role.\u00a0That is, I propose to require each fully grown human to pair up with a \u201cresponsible adult\u201d org, ready to pay for all they do wrong, and able to limit their behavior. To avoid mistreatment and allow adaptation to varying context, allow those fully grown humans the freedom to choose a mutually-agreeable adult, but require them to pick one.If someone can find a voucher willing to back their being treated fully as an adult, well then I\u2019m okay with that person being treated that way. But if no voucher is willing to back that stance, I don\u2019t see why I should back it either. This may be as libertarian as I\u2019m willing to go.Added 11a: As Stefan Schubert notes, we can also see adult-dependent status in they ways that parties talk to each other.

In this post I want to reconsider who should fill that role.The main role of an \u201cadult\u201d is to think carefully about what to do, and then do it reliably, with action choices that account well for their effects on others. That is, an adult has autonomy, self-control, and intelligence to make choices well and reliably, but also faces social incentives adequate to make them play well with others. Or at least play similarly well to the other available adults. Adults can be relied on to do the important things than need doing, and yet can be given great autonomy to decide what to do how and why.A key subsidiary adult role is to manage \u201cdependents\u201d who are not up to filling this role.

We match each such dependent to an adult \u201cguardian\u201d, allow that guardian to limit dependent behavior, and hold that guardian responsible for such behavior.

{"completion": " 3.  Finally, consider the question, \u201cWhich creatures should be created?\u201d in a future where factories can make a wide range of creatures. This situation might arise with whole brain emulation, or advanced genetic engineering. \u00a0Imagine a\u00a0supply-and-demand world where many similar competing profit-seeking factories can each make many possible creatures with great precision, endowing them with any preferred debts or rights, but aren\u2019t overly limited by intellectual property rights.  When creating creatures is such a competitive industry, supply and demand has strong implications.All creatures would be created that could clearly pay for themselves (including intellectual property license fees minus existence donations).  Since there are vastly more possible creatures than room for actual creatures, costs to exist would be prohibitively high. Most new creatures would have designs near the peak of factory profitability, and own little surplus relative to their cost. Residual control rights (e.g., \u201care they slaves?\u201d) would rest in the hands of whomever could squeeze the most market value from them. \u00a0Yes a few would get lucky and become rich enough to have slack for leisure and existence donations; but theirs would be only a small fraction of total wealth. And in a supply and demand world, this distribution of existence, control, and wealth would be Pareto-optimal, economically efficient, and hence good for all the usual reasons.Another exception to these creature patterns could be due to ancient legacies, of those who held large initial endowments before this competitive regime began.  The designs of such ancient creatures, and of new creatures they favored with existence donations, might be unusually far from the peak of factory profitability.  Other creatures might question the legitimacy of special creatures who would not exist if not for such legacy assets. \u00a0They might complain, \u201cWhy do such legacies get to be apparent exceptions to the general rule that creatures must pay their way to exist?\u201d Of course if legacy assets were deeply entrenched in social institutions, yet represented only a tiny fraction of wealth, these might remain mere complaints.Tin-pot dictators and supporting elites often keep their nations poor and inefficient out of (often valid) concerns that efficient economies might no longer tolerate their grabbing such large wealth fractions. Similarly, you might fear you would lose relative power in the above scenario of efficient future creatures. So you might prefer an inefficient legacy control scenario, where your generation coordinates to finely control of all future economies, to be tin-pot dictators of the future. \u00a0You might try to prevent the creation of these efficient creatures, in favor of creatures you decide should exist, serving you or not as you choose.If asked what gives you the right to prevent the existence of creatures who could fully pay for themselves, you might respond that you need no right, if you have power and a will to use it. \u00a0Or perhaps you\u2019ll say ethics assures you it is simply impossible to be unfair to creatures who don\u2019t yet exist. \u00a0But wearing my\u00a0efficient economist hat, I cannot support such naked selfish aggression, even if I thought it would work. \u00a0And knowing how hard is coordination, I have serious doubts re feasibility. If you can identify large negative externalities, I will help you to find ways to price them, to discourage the creation of creatures who cannot fully pay for themselves, and the theft of legacy assets. \u00a0But if not, I prefer to help creatures who can pay for their existence obtain that exquisite treasure.Added 1Sep: Let \u201cwants to exist\u201d be \u201cwould want to exist if it existed.\u201d\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: August 30, 2010 6:00 pm \nTitle: Who Should Exist?\nThe question of what people should exist seems complex and subtle, but basic economic theory suggests it may get a lot simpler in the future.

In addition, current versions of software systems also tend to dominate over old older versions. (E.g., Windows 10 over Windows 8.)However, in many other technology competitions, older technologies remain widely used over long periods.

{"completion": " Note that techs that tend to dominate strongly, like asphalt, air-conditioning, and new software versions, more often appear as a lumpy change, e.g., all at once, rather than via a slow accumulation of many changes. That is, they more often result from one or a few key innovations, and have some simple essential commonality. In contrast, techs that have more internal variety and structure tend more to result from the accumulation of more smaller innovations.Now consider the competition between humans and computers for mental work. Today human brains earn more than half of world income, far more than the costs of computer hardware and software. But over time, artificial hardware and software have been improving, and slowly commanding larger fractions. Eventually this could become a majority. And a key question is then: how quickly might computers come to dominate overwhelmingly, doing virtually all mental work?On the one hand, the ranges here are truly enormous. We are talking about all mental work, which covers a very wide of environments. And not only do humans vary widely in abilities and inclinations, but computer systems seem to encompass an even wider range of designs and approaches. And many of these are quite complex systems. These facts together suggest that the older tech of human brains could last quite a long time (relative of course to relevant timescales) after computers came to do the majority of tasks (weighted by income), and that the change over that period could be relatively gradual.For an analogy, consider the space of all possible non-mental work. While machines have surely been displacing humans for a long time in this area, we still do many important tasks \u201cby hand\u201d, and overall change has been pretty steady for a long time period. This change looked nothing like a single \u201cgeneral\u201d machine taking over all the non-mental tasks all at once.On the other hand, human minds are today stuck in old bio hardware that isn\u2019t improving much, while artificial computer hardware has long been improving rapidly. Both these states, of hardware being stuck and improving fast, have been relatively uniform within each category and across environments. As a result, this hardware advantage might plausibly overwhelm software variety to make humans quickly lose most everywhere.However, eventually brain emulations (i.e. \u201cems\u201d) should be possible, after which artificial software would no longer have a hardware advantage over brain software; they would both have access to the same hardware. (As ems are an all-or-nothing tech that quite closely substitutes for humans and yet can have a huge hardware advantage, ems should displace most all humans over a short period.)\u00a0At that point, the broad variety of mental task environments, and of approaches to both artificial and em software, suggests that ems many well stay competitive on many job tasks, and that this status might last a long time, with change being gradual.Note also that as ems should soon become much cheaper than humans, the introduction of ems should initially cause a big reversion, wherein ems take back many of the mental job tasks that humans had recently lost to computers.In January I posted a theoretical account that adds to this expectation. It explains why we should expect brain software to be a marvel of integration and abstraction, relative to the stronger reliance on modularity that we see in artificial software, a reliance that allows those systems to be smaller and faster built, but also causes them to rot faster. This account suggests that for a long time it would take unrealistically large investments for artificial software to learn to be as good as brain software on the tasks where brains excel.A contrary view often expressed is that at some point someone will \u201cinvent\u201d AGI (= Artificial General Intelligence). Not that society will eventually have broadly capable and thus general systems as a result of the world economy slowly collecting many specific tools and abilities over a long time. But that instead a particular research team somewhere will discover one or a few key insights that allow that team to quickly create a system that can do most all mental tasks much better than all the other systems, both human and artificial, in the world at that moment. This insight might quickly spread to other teams, or it might be hoarded to give this team great relative power.Yes, under this sort of scenario it becomes more plausible that artificial software will either quickly displace humans on most all jobs, or do the same to ems if they exist at the time. But it is this scenario that I have repeatedly argued is pretty crazy. (Not impossible, but crazy enough that only a small minority should assume or explore it.) While the lumpiness of innovation that we\u2019ve seen so far in computer science has been modest and not out of line with most other research fields, this crazy view postulates an enormously lumpy innovation, far out of line with anything we\u2019ve seen in a long while. We have no good reason to believe that such a thing is at all likely.If we presume that no one team will ever invent AGI, it becomes far more plausible that there will still be plenty of jobs tasks for ems to do, whenever ems show up. Even if working ems only collect 10% of world income soon after ems appear, the scenario I laid out in my book Age of Em is still pretty relevant. That scenario is actually pretty robust to such variations. As a result of thinking about these considerations, I\u2019m now much more confident that the Age of Em will happen.In Age of Em, I said:Conditional on my key assumptions, I expect at least 30 percent of future situations to be usefully informed by my analysis. Unconditionally, I expect at least 5 percent.I now estimate an unconditional 80% chance of it being a useful guide, and so will happily take bets based on a 50-50 chance estimate. My claim is something like:Within the first D econ doublings after ems are as cheap as the median human worker, there will be a period where >X% of world income is paid for em work. And during that period Age of Em will be a useful guide to that world.Note that this analysis suggests that while the arrival of ems might cause a relatively sudden and disruptive transition, the improvement of other artificial software would likely be more gradual. While overall rates of growth and change should increase as a larger fraction of the means of production comes to be made in factories, the risk is low of a sudden AI advance relative to that overall rate of change. Those concerned about risks caused by AI changes can more reasonably wait until we see clearer signs of problems.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: July 9, 2019 11:17 am \nTitle: Why Age of Em Will Happen\nIn some technology competitions, winners dominate strongly.

{"completion": " Yes, this sort of transition is a long way off; \u201cthis time isn\u2019t different\u201d yet. There may be centuries still to go. And if we first achieve HLAI via the relatively steady accumulation of better software, as we have been doing for seventy years, we may get plenty of warning about such a transition. However, if we instead first achieve HLAI via ems, as elaborated in my book, we may get much less warning; only five years might elapse between seeing visible effects and all jobs lost. Given how slowly our political systems typically changes state redistribution and insurance arrangements, it might be wiser to just set up a system far in advance that could deal with such problems if and when they appear. (A system also flexible enough to last over this long time scale.)The ideal solution is global insurance. Buy insurance for citizens that pays off only when most biological humans lose their jobs, and have this insurance pay enough so these people don\u2019t starve. Pay premiums well in advance, and use a stable insurance supplier with sufficient reinsurance. Don\u2019t trust local assets to be sufficient to support\u00a0local self-insurance; the economic gains from an HLAI\u00a0economy may be very concentrated in a few dense cities of unknown locations.Alas, political systems are even worse at preparing for problems that seem unlikely anytime soon. Which raises the question: should those who want to push for state HLAI insurance ally with folks focused on other issues? And that brings us to \u201cuniversal basic income\u201d (UBI), a topic in the news lately, and about which many have asked me in relation to my book.Yes, there are many difficult issues with UBI, such as how strongly the public would favor it relative to traditional poverty programs, whether it would replace or add onto those other programs, and if replacing how much that could cut administrative costs and reduce poverty targeting. But in this post, I want to focus on how UBI might help to insure against job loss from relatively sudden unexpected HLAI.Imagine a small \u201cdemonstration level\u201d UBI, just big enough to one side to say \u201cokay we started a UBI, now it is your turn to lower other poverty programs, before we raise UBI more.\u201d Even such a small UBI might be enough to deal with HLAI, if its basic income level were tied to the average income level. After all, an HLAI economy could grow very fast, allowing very fast growth in the incomes that biological human gain from owning most of the capital in this new economy. Soon only a small fraction of that income could cover a low but starvation-averting UBI.For example, a UBI set to x% of average income can be funded via a less than x% tax on all income over this UBI level. Since average US income per person is now $50K, a 10% version gives a UBI of $5K. While this might not let\u00a0one live in an expensive city, a year ago I visited a 90-adult rural Virginia commune where this was actually their average income. Once freed from regulations, we might see more innovations like this in how to spend UBI.However, I do see one big problem. Most UBI proposals are funded out of local general tax revenue, while the income of a HLAI economy might be quite unevenly distributed around the globe. The smaller the political unit considering a UBI, the worse this problem gets. Better insurance would come from a UBI that is funded out of a diversified global investment portfolio. But that isn\u2019t usually how governments fund things. What to do?A solution that occurs to me is to push for a World Basic Income (WBI). That is, try to create and grow a coalition of nations that implement a common basic income level, supported by a shared set of assets and contributions. I\u2019m not sure how to set up the details, but citizens in any of these nations should get the same untaxed basic income, even if they face differing taxes on incomes above this level. And this alliance of\u00a0nations would commit somehow to sharing some pool of assets and revenue to pay for this common basic income, so that everyone could expect to continue to receive their WBI even after an uneven disruptive HLAI revolution.Yes, richer member nations of\u00a0this alliance could achieve less local poverty reduction, as the shared WBI level couldn\u2019t be above what the poor member nations could afford.\u00a0But a common basic income should make it easier to let citizens move within this set of nations. You\u2019d less have to worry about poor folks moving to your nation to take advantage of your poverty programs. And the more that poverty reduction were implemented via WBI, the bigger would be this advantage.Yes, this seems a tall order, probably too tall. Probably nations won\u2019t prepare, and will then respond to a HLAI transition slowly, and only with what ever resources they have at their disposal, which in some places will be too little. Which is why I recommend that individuals and smaller groups try to arrange their own assets, insurance, and sharing. Yes, it won\u2019t be needed for a while, but if you wait\u00a0until the signs of something big soon are clear, it\u00a0might then be too late.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: July 18, 2016 9:00 pm \nTitle: World Basic Income\nJoseph said ..

Yes, how nice a response, and how strongly or visibly we expect this, varies with context. For example, it depends on the prior relation between A and B, on who is aware of these nice things, on the relative costs to A and B of their nice things, on the kinds of nice things done, on if A was authorized to do their nice thing, on if A did their thing hoping for a reciprocal response, on if A could have or did propose an explicit trade, and on if B accepted such a proposal.At one extreme we have legally enforced debts, which are excused only in extreme situations (e.g., bankruptcy), while at the other extreme we have only weakly enforced social norms. For example, often when two people in sequence enter two doors in quick succession, the first person holds open the first door for the second person, and then that second person is expected to hold open the second door for the first person. They won\u2019t be arrested if they fail, and observers might excuse them if they seem to be in an unusual rush, or less physically able to to open doors. But otherwise observers may think tend to think a bit less of them.The Hare Krishna religion once famously gamed this effect by offering flowers to passersby in airports, and then holding out bags for reciprocal donations. This worked, at least for a while.Note that in many kinds of relations we can prefer that A and B have other motives for doing nice things for each other, besides the threat of censure for violating reciprocity norms.

This happens under the ancient and well-established law against \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d.All of which brings me to my father\u2019s day theme: you owe your parents some grandkids. They did something very nice for you by creating you. (Yes, a few of you might be exceptions who were hurt by this, but only a few.) Yes, they didn\u2019t ask you first, but they couldn\u2019t have asked you first. (That will be different for ems, who can be asked before making a new copy.) And not begin asking first is only one of many factors that can weaken, but not usually eliminate, your debt.Most parents did in fact hope that creating kids might lead to grandkids, and grandkids are one of things parents most often and greatly hope for from their kids. Yes, you might be excused if your parents were especially mean to you in other ways, or if having grandkids would be a special hardship for you. Yes, we might not want to make this debt legally enforceable, and yes it might be better if you did such things out of generosity or gratitude, rather than out of feelings of obligation. But even so, you do owe them grandkids, even if only a bit.You exist only because of an unbroken chain of parents that goes back to the origin of life. I like to compare this to the \u201chuman chains\u201d often used to rescue people drowning in the ocean. If you are in such a chain, you have an obligation not to let go of those next to you in the chain, as everyone after you may then drown. I tend to think that you have similar obligations to your chain of ancestors and descendants; if you don\u2019t have kids, all of the chain after you won\u2019t exist.Yes, many people (falsely) think that you can\u2019t have obligations to people who don\u2019t yet exist. Which is why I like to point them to this obligation to their parents, who very much do or did exist. Most of your parents, and their parents, all the way back along the chain, wanted you to continue the chain. And you owe them this, at least a bit.Added: In the case of the two doors, I\u2019d say you have an obligation to put substantial weight in your decision-making on trying to reciprocate. But if even with adding that weight, it turns out that you are better off not opening that second door, you are excused. This is why we excuse those who are in a rush, or who have less physical ability to open the door.\n\n@@@\n\n", "prompt": "Date: June 19, 2022 12:20 pm \nTitle: You Owe Your Parents Grandkids\nHumans have long respected a reciprocity norm: after A does something nice for B, then B is expected to do something nice for A. Yes, how nice a response, and how strongly or visibly we expect this, varies with context. For example, it depends on the prior relation between A and B, on who is aware of these nice things, on the relative costs to A and B of their nice things, on the kinds of nice things done, on if A was authorized to do their nice thing, on if A did their thing hoping for a reciprocal response, on if A could have or did propose an explicit trade, and on if B accepted such a proposal.At one extreme we have legally enforced debts, which are excused only in extreme situations (e.g., bankruptcy), while at the other extreme we have only weakly enforced social norms. For example, often when two people in sequence enter two doors in quick succession, the first person holds open the first door for the second person, and then that second person is expected to hold open the second door for the first person. They won\u2019t be arrested if they fail, and observers might excuse them if they seem to be in an unusual rush, or less physically able to to open doors. But otherwise observers may think tend to think a bit less of them.The Hare Krishna religion once famously gamed this effect by offering flowers to passersby in airports, and then holding out bags for reciprocal donations. This worked, at least for a while.Note that in many kinds of relations we can prefer that A and B have other motives for doing nice things for each other, besides the threat of censure for violating reciprocity norms. Even so, observers may still disapprove if they see a very lopsided relation, with one doing far more for the other than vice versa.\n\n###\n\n"}
