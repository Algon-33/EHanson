Reading through the comments lately a correlation stands out:  those who are dead wrong are on average more passionate than those who are more nearly right.  This correlation seems an obvious explanation for the usual boring academic demeanor; those of us who want to be thought right must try not to seem too passionate.  But though I accept this sad fate for now, my curiosity (passionately?) cries out: why?! Why are the wrong more passionate?
