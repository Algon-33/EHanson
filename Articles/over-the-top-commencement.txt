Listening to my son’s high school graduation ceremony last night, I was struck by how completely implausible were many speaker claims, such as:

Never let anyone tell you there is something you can’t do.
You’ll have setbacks, but never let them discourage you.
If I can succeed, so can you.
We’ll always treasure our memories of high school.
We students are so thankful to have such a friendly principal.

I was embarrassed to be associated with such transparent falsehoods, but apparently I’m in a minority.  What obvious lies have you heard at commencement, and why do you think such lies were told?
