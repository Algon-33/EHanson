Late on a freezing grey afternoon last December, Adam Ford filmed me outside in front of Oxford’s Christ’s Church, me all bundled up a coat, scarf, and cap. Youtube says Ford has 506 videos (and more at Vimeo), almost all talking to futurists, so he’s pretty experienced at this. He edited our talk down to 31 minutes; these were our topics:

Morality Tales, The Future, And You
Future Thinking Near & Far Modes
Utopia
Whole Brain Emulation
Dystopia
Mythology
Escapism
Nature & Progress
Acceleration & Change
Risks & Growth Trajectories
The Road Ahead

Other recent short videos of mine: TEDx Tallinn talk (19min), my BBC Interview (4min).
