Today we welcome a fourth author at Overcoming Bias: Carl Shulman. The other authors have known Carl for many years, heâ€™s posted here at OB before, and while we (ok, I) have often disagreed, heâ€™s consistently thoughtful, clear, and interested in interesting topics. You can read more about Carl here, here, and here, but I suggest you mainly just listen to what he has to say. ðŸ™‚
