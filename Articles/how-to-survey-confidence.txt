In a 3-point elicitation procedure, an expert is asked for a lower  limit, upper limit, and best guess, the two limits creating an interval  of some assigned confidence level (e.g., 80%). In our 4-step interval  elicitation procedure, experts were also asked for a realistic lower  limit, upper limit, and best guess, but no confidence level was  assigned; the fourth step was to rate their anticipated confidence in  the interval produced. … We … found average  overconfidence of 11.9%, 95% CI [3.5, 20.3] (a hit rate of 68.1% for 80%  intervals)—a substantial decrease in overconfidence compared with  previous studies.
