In this audio interview at Pale Blue Dot, we discuss the title topic of this blog, how to overcome bias.  I’m less optimistic about personal checklists of biases to avoid, and more optimistic about track records and other ways to change your incentives. Unfortunately, we talked over the phone, so my voice sound is low quality.  But if you can get past that, the topics are interesting.
