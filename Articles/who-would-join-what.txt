Bryan Caplan, Tim Kane, and I disagreed at lunch today on these three questions:   If an election were held tomorrow, in what nations would a majority vote to have their nation join these unions:

The United States (as a state)
The European Union (as a nation)
A Worldwide Democracy (as individuals)

Bryan thought China and India would join #3; I thought that unlikely.  Bryan thought few would join #1; I agree most would not, but think many would.  What do you think?
