After someÂ prodding by TGGP, I tried to dig into data studies on the relation between violence and sex ratios. Alas this seems to be one of those areas where results are all across the map:
More men make more violence: here, here,
More men make less violence: here, here, here.
Mixed results: here, here.
I quit, and tentatively conclude the evidence is unclear.
