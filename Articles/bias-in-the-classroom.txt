Imagine I’m a professor who is going to lecture my students on global warming. Further assume that after carefully looking at the evidence I conclude that there is a 60% chance that global warming is true. So if I was the only one to lecture on global warming I would devote 60% of my lecture to evidence in support of the theory and 40% to evidence opposed to it.
 





But now imagine that I know that most of my students will be taught about global warming in other classes. Further assume that all the other professors at my college are 100% certain that global warming is true. These other professors, therefore, will only present evidence in favor of global warming. To cause students to get as unbiased a view as possible of global warming (from my prospective) shouldn’t I devote my entire lecture to criticizing global warming theory?
 





Imagine a professor has some ideology such as libertarianism or Marxism that is unusual at his college.  The professor has this view because after looking at the evidence he decides it provides the best explanation of how the world works.  The professor thinks that 20% of an unbiased education would consist of learning his ideology.  But the professor knows that students won’t encounter his ideology outside of his classroom.  Doesn’t this mean that to help the students get what the professor believes is an unbiased education the professor should devote far more than 20% of his lecture time to discussing his ideology?
