We have often pondered the question: when you find that you and someone else disagree, how much weight should you give to your and their opinions in forming your new opinion?Â  To explore this, Iâ€™ve worked out a simple math model of disagreement between two â€œBayesian wannabesâ€œ, i.e., agents who are trying to act like Bayesians, but know that they make mistakes, and try to adjust for this fact.
Consider two agents, A and B, having a conversation about a truth t = x1 + x2 + x3 + â€¦Â  First A sees clue x1, and reports r1, his estimate of truth t.Â  Â Next B sees report r1, and also clue x2, and then reports r2, his estimate of truth t.Â  A now sees report r2, a new clue x3 and reports r3.Â  The two of them could go back and forth like this for a long time.
If A and B were perfect Bayesians (and if each xi were independently and normally distributed with zero mean and a known variance Vi), then we would have ri = xi + ri-1.Â  When combining their last two expressed opinions, each agent puts zero weight on his own last report, and just adds his new clue to the other agentâ€™s last report!
OK, but what about imperfect agents?Â  I assume:


when making report ri, each agent can only remember his last clue xi and the two most recent reports, what he last heard ri-1 and what he last said ri-2.
while such agents would like to compute the perfect Bayesian estimate bi = E[t|xi,ri-1,ri-2], they can only produce an approximation ai = bi + ei, (where each ei is independently and normally distributed with zero mean and a known variance Ei),
they know they make such mistakes, and so adjust, producing a calibrated estimate ri = E[t|ai], and
everyone knows and agrees on the new info per round Vi and thinking noise per round Ei.

Thus we should have
A reports r1 = E[t| e1 + E[t|x1] ]
B reports r2 = E[t| e2 + E[t|x2,r1] ]
A reports r3 = E[t| e3 + E[t|x3,r2,r1] ]
B reports r4 = E[t| e4 + E[t|x4,r3,r2] ]
A reports r5 = E[t| e5 + E[t|x5,r4,r3] ]Â  and so on.
These reports turn out to be linear, of the form:
ri = (weight on last clue)*xi + (weight on other guy)*ri-1 + (weight on self)*ri-2 + noise
Iâ€™ve made a spreadsheet calculating these weights.Â  Here are weights after hearing ten reports, for different combinations of info and noise (assumed same across rounds and agents):



New info

This table considers cases where the agents differ:

I see lots of interesting patterns, but Iâ€™ll let commentors point them out. ðŸ™‚
