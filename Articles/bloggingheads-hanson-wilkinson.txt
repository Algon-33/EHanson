My BloggingHeads discussion with Will Wilkinson was posted today.  We talked about overcoming bias, cryonics, social status, self-deception, disagreement, and more.  I obviously need a better camera setup and more reliable phone line.  Oddly I guess, an hour seems a short time to talk – I could enjoy going on like that for a whole day.
