Apparently there are blog readers whoâ€™d like to meet in Helsinki while Iâ€™m visiting.Â  So we will meet Thursday July 10 at Loiste at 20:00 local time.Â  (Itâ€™s on the 10th floor.)Â  
Added 11July:  Thanks to all who came for a great evening!Â  Clearly Helsinki has an OB weight far out of proportion to its world population fraction. ðŸ™‚
