The first stop to overcoming a problem is to admit you have one. So: I admit Iâ€™m addicted to blogging. In terms of total interesting intellectual insight, Iâ€™m actually pretty proud of my 5.5 years of blogging â€“ I doubt I would have produced more insight had I blogged less. But my friends, colleagues, academia, patrons, etc. donâ€™t want me to just find insights, they want me to gain prestige and have influence. And at this point in my life, they are right â€” intellectual influence *is what I should want. My insights will matter little if I canâ€™t package them in a form that will tempt others to assimilate and build on them.
So, I am writing a book (which Iâ€™ll say more about in due time). Which feels great. Alas, I think readers prefer near-daily blogs, Iâ€™m reluctant to let this blog die, and as it is I get too easily engrossed in blog post topics. My solution: move Overcoming Bias back to a group blog, by including the young rising stars Katja Grace and Robert Wiblin, of whom Iâ€™ve long been a fan. We have mutual respect, similar interests, and similar styles of thought. With them posting more, Iâ€™ll hopefully be ok posting less. Overcoming Bias will continue at a similar rate and on similar themes, my less frequent posts will be more thoughtful and less newsy, and Iâ€™ll actually get a book written. Whatâ€™s not to like? ðŸ˜‰
Btw, we arenâ€™t seeking more authors â€“ just the three of us are ok for a while.
