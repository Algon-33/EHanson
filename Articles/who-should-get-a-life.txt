A common complaint about nerds is that they should “get a life.”  For example, parents, teachers, etc. feel quite justifying in tsk-tsking hackers who spend most of their hours in front of a computer screen. Interestingly, we don’t feel much inclined to complain about athletes who are similarly focused.  Alex quotes Wallace ’95:
It’s better for us not to know the kinds of sacrifices the professional-grade athlete has made to get so very good at one particular thing. … The actual facts of the sacrifices repel us when we see them. … Note the way “up close and personal” profiles of professional athletes strain so hard to find evidence of a rounded human life — outside interests and activities, values beyond the sport. We ignore what’s obvious, that most of this straining is farce.
This seems to me yet another example of people picking on nerds more because nerds are widely disliked.
Added 11a: Many suggest that “get a life” means “get popular, high status.”  OK, I can buy that.
