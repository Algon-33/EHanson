As of 10am (EST) today we have had 100,019 distinct visits and 221,616 page views, in the 116 days Overcoming Bias has been operating.Â  In this time weâ€™ve had 3189 comments and 229 posts (of which Iâ€™ve written 118).Â  Â I wish I could quote some measure of how much bias we have overcome.Â  ðŸ™‚
We could have created a blog with just a few contributors, which would have better controlled post quality.Â  Â The reason we invited many contributors is because we hoped to create a conversation and community.Â  Â So let me encourage contributors to have conversations with each other here on our key issues, and let us think about how we as a community might overcome bias better than we could alone.Â
