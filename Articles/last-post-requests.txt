I’m strongly tempted to quit blogging for a while, to free up time for more ambitious projects. My two year anniversary is coming up in a few weeks.  If I quit then it would be nice to have some sense of completion.  Toward that end, are there any post topics you’d like to request?  Perhaps posts I once promised or at least suggested I might someday make?
