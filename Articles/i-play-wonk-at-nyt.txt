Over at the NYT blog “Room for Debate”, I weigh in on whether we should let age 55-65 folks opt into Medicare:
This is instead a hail Mary pass to save the reform game on the last play, and there’s just no way they can think this through well by Christmas. … If you’d look at what they are serving before eating in the light of day, why eat when they choose to serve in the dark?
Commenting there along with six distinguished health policy wonks makes me feel almost … normal. 🙂
