I just got a lovely gift of a song called "I'll Think of a Reason Later" by Lee Ann Womack.  Maybe some of you already know it.  Here is the chorus:

It may be my family's redneck nature Rubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behavior It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger But I don't like her She may be an angel who spends all winter Bringin' the homeless blankets and dinner A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner But I really hate her I'll think of a reason later

Tasty.
