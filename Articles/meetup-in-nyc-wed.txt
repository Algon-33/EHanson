I’m speaking (privately) in NYC Thursday, and arrive Wednesday evening (staying on 54th St.).  If NYC folks are interested in meeting up at say 8pm, can anyone suggest a good location, perhaps flexible re the number who show?
  Added 10June:  OK, the plan is to meet at Connolly’s (43 W. 54th St. 212-489-0271) from 8pm on.  I presume we’ll hang out at the bar at first. 
Added 12June:  The meetup last night was lots of fun -thanks to all (~15) who came.
