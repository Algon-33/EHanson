Next Big Future’s Sander Olson interviewed me (short text here), and Ted Goertzel (Ben’s dad) had me give a guest lecture (1.5hr vid/slides here) for his Singularity Studies class at Rutgers.  I didn’t say anything new, but some may enjoy them.  Sander tried a bit too hard to quote me as forecasting big change soon; the vid gives a more accurate impression.
