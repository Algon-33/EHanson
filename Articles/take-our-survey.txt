Grad student Jason Briggeman and I would love for you to take our overcoming-bias related survey, and perhaps win a $100 Visa gift card.  I wish I could say more about it here, but we don’t want to bias your answers.  After we get enough answers and analyze them, we’ll tell you what we found.  Please don’t read the comments until you’ve taken the survey.
