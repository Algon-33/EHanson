Robin and I have a new podcast on the subject of play (mp3, wav, m4a). Older ones are here.
Don’t be thrown by a bit of silence at the start of the m4a one. We also don’t have the time right now to figure out how to put it in better formats. Sorry about that. If anyone else does, and posts such files, I’ll link to them.
