On the 4/29/07 episode of The Simpsons there was a sign at Springfield Little League Park reading:
"Warning:  Your child is not as good as you think he is."
For most parents, (although certainly not my wife and I because we underestimate our son’s greatness) this sign would help correct bias.  So, should signs like this be posted occasionally?
