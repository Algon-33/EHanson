Who is the most idealistic about mating?  It seems to me it is children, post-menopausal women, and young male “nerds”, i.e., with especially weak current mating prospects. These folks talk as if they hold themselves and others to the highest standards of ideal love, while happening to speak when they have an especially low chance of fertile sex.
Coincidence?  I think not. Remember, sex is near; love is far.  In Far  Thoughts Fit Ideals, I said:
We tend more to say  we will act in accord with our verbally expressed and proudly embraced  abstract ideals, e.g., individualism, collectivism, universalism,  environmentalism, when we are put into the mental mode that was designed  more for talking relative to doing – the far mode.  In contrast, when  we are in our usual near mode … we tend to ignore those abstract ideals,  … practically achieving our usual ends.
