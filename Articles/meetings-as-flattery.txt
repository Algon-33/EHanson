The real reason leaders end up in too many meetings? Because it’s flattering: having your presence “required” at many meetings makes you feel important — it’s tangible proof of how much your people and your organization need you. But being in too many meetings every day wreaks havoc on your schedule and your ability to focus on bigger goals. I’ve seen too many corporate leaders sacrifice their own strategic vision — and ultimately, their own performance — because they’ve let themselves become hostage to Conference Room B.
More here.  Much of business process functions to signal who is important and who is allied with whom, rather than to actually get stuff done.  Huge efficiency gains await the organizations that can figure out how to expunge these parasites.
