Robin and I will both be in the Bay Area early for the Singularity Summit. We’d like to warm up for the big weekend with a little Overcoming Bias/LessWrong meetup party. The folks of 2135 Oregon St have kindly lent their home for this purpose, so please join us there between 7 and 10pm on Thurs 11 October to practice chatting about important and interesting things and maybe dance a bit. There’ll be some snacks and drinks, but feel free to bring more. There’ll be street parking and Ashby Bart station half a mile away. Hopefully there’ll be Robin dancing.
